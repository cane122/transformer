Introduction
The domestic cat, or house cat, is a small mammal that has lived among people for thousands of years. People have kept cats as pets, used them as hunters, and even worshipped them as gods. Domestic cats belong to the same animal family as the lion, tiger, jaguar, leopard, puma, and cheetah. The scientific name of the domestic cat is Felis catus.
Where Cats Live
Domestic cats live with people in nearly every part of the world. Some domestic cats have no home. These cats, called feral cats, wander freely in many cities.
Physical Features and Breeds
The domestic cat has a long and powerfully built body. Males are about 28 inches (71 centimeters) long. Females are about 20 inches (51 centimeters) long. Large eyes help the cat to see well at night. Its triangular ears can turn quickly toward the source of a sound. Four rows of stiff whiskers grow on each side of the nose. These give the cat a delicate sense of touch.
A cat’s fur may be black, white, brown, gray, yellow, red, or orange. It may also be striped (tabby); a mixture of white, black, and yellow (tortoiseshell); or marked with patches of color (calico). Cats use their rough tongues to comb and to clean their fur.

There are many breeds of domestic cat. Cats of the same breed have a similar length of hair and other similar features. Most breeds—for example, the Abyssinian, the American Shorthair, and the Siamese—have short hair. Other breeds, including the Persian, have long, thick coats.

Domestic cats are carnivores, or meat-eaters. Many hunt and eat small animals, including birds, mice, and rabbits. They use their claws, which they can draw back or in, and their strong, sharp teeth to catch prey. House cats eat mainly canned or dry food made especially for cats.

The cat is the only animal that makes a sound called a purr. Cats produce purring in their throat. No one knows exactly why cats purr, but it may be a sign of comfort. Cats also make other sounds, including meowing, hissing, yowling, and growling.

A female cat gives birth to a litter of kittens about two months after mating. A female may have two to three litters a year. The average litter is four kittens, but there may be only one kitten or as many as seven. A newborn kitten is about 3 inches (8 centimeters) long. It has no teeth, the ears lie flat, and the eyes are closed. A kitten’s full development takes about one year. Cats may live to be about 15 years old.

Cats and Humans
About 4,500 years ago the ancient Egyptians worshipped cats. The Egyptians probably domesticated, or tamed, wild cats about 3,500 years ago. They used these cats to kill the rats and mice that ate their stored grain.

During the Middle Ages (about ad 500–1500), many Europeans feared cats because cats were linked with witches. Some people still think that black cats are unlucky.

Today millions of people around the world keep cats as pets. In the United States there are more pet cats than pet dogs.

INTRODUCTION 
Cats—domestic and wild—have intrigued humans for thousands of years, and throughout that time the relationship of these animals with humans has varied widely. People have valued cats as hunters, worshiped them as gods, and sacrificed them as demons. Many of the 37 species of cats have often been used as symbols of beauty, grace, mystery, and power, and they have been favorite subjects for many artists and writers throughout the world. Cats are mammals that belong to the cat family, Felidae. They include lynxes, jaguars, lions, leopards, and tigers, as well as domestic cats.

Today, the domestic cat (house cat) is one of the most popular house pets. No one knows exactly how many domestic cats there are in the world. However, it is estimated that in the United States alone there are from 75 to 95 million pet cats. This does not include the numbers of homeless cats that roam about freely as feral animals (those that had been tame but have returned to living in a wild state). There probably are many millions of such cats wandering about in the streets and alleys of cities and towns throughout the world. The scientific name of the domestic cat is Felis catus.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
As the graceful cat moves, the powerful muscles of its long, lithe body ripple under the soft fur. At rest, every line of its body curves into a graceful arc. The overall impression of the animal sometimes is one of complete calm. This perception is shattered when the cat suddenly springs for attack with its ears flattened and fangs and claws bared.

The cats as a group range widely in size. The great (or “big”) cats, including the lion and tiger, are the largest. The domestic cat is one of the smallest. An adult domestic cat is about 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 centimeters) high. The length from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail averages 18 to 20 inches (46 to 51 centimeters), and the tail is about 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) long. Females usually weigh from 6 to 10 pounds (2.7 to 4.5 kilograms) and males from 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.8 kilograms). However, among nonpedigreed cats, weights up to 28 pounds (12.7 kilograms) are not uncommon.

THE HEAD AND BODY

The cat’s head is large compared with the rest of the body. The nose and jaws are short, so the face seems flat when compared with the faces of many other kinds of mammals such as dogs, horses, and rodents. The triangular ears taper to rounded or pointed tips and stand erect in almost all breeds. A cat has keen hearing and can detect many sounds that humans cannot hear. A cat usually turns its head, not only its eyes, in the direction of a sound. This aids both hearing and vision. The inner ear is a bony structure of fluid-filled semicircular canals. In the cat, as in humans, it contains a complicated mechanism for maintaining body balance. It is this mechanism, not the cat’s tail, that enables the animal to land on its feet when it falls.

The cat’s large and prominent eyes are placed well forward on the head and, like the eyes of humans, they face forward. The cat comes closer than does any other animal except owls and apes to having binocular vision similar to humans. In binocular vision, the left eye and the right eye view an object from slightly different angles, allowing for better depth perception.

The size and position of the eyes permit as much light as possible to enter them and ensure an extensive field of vision. These are important factors in hunting and nighttime prowling. A cat cannot see in total darkness, but it can see better in dim light than can most other kinds of animals.

In bright light a cat’s pupils contract to narrow vertical slits. In the dark these slits enlarge to round openings that admit a maximum amount of light. The eyes seem to shine in the dark. This effect results from even the smallest amount of light striking a reflective layer of iridescent green or yellow crystalline needles lining the back of the eye. The eyes of the Siamese cat appear red in the dark, as the retinas lack pigment, and the color is provided by blood vessels.

A cat is very alert to any movement, but it probably cannot distinguish color. For these reasons, it will pounce when a victim moves but may not attack prey that remains still.

The tip of a cat’s nose, the leather, may be black, reddish, or pink and is usually cool and moist. All cats have an acute sense of smell and can detect prey or their favorite delicacies at surprising distances.

A cat’s whiskers, or vibrissae, serve as delicate sense organs of touch. Four rows of stiff whiskers grow on the upper lip on each side of the nose. Small groups of whiskers also are situated on other parts of the body including above each eye, on both cheeks, and on the backs of the forepaws. Cutting off the whiskers not only detracts from the animal’s appearance but also impairs its ability to feel its way about.

A cat’s teeth serve primarily as weapons, as well as for tearing food. Most cats, including domestic cats, have 30 permanent teeth—16 in the upper jaw and 14 in the lower. The strongest and sharpest are the four large, curved, pointed fangs (canines). With these teeth the cat grasps and tears its food or an enemy. The small front teeth (upper and lower incisors) function chiefly as grooming aids. The cat has fewer side teeth (premolars and molars) than do most other mammals. In most mammals the side teeth are used for grinding food. The cat uses these teeth only for cutting.

cat's tongue
A cat’s tongue is rough. The tongue of a domestic cat feels much like coarse sandpaper. The tongue of a big wild cat, such as the lion or the tiger, is even rougher. The tongue surface is covered with rasplike projections or barbs that face backward into the throat. All cats use their tongues to clean and comb the fur. Their tongues are also efficient tools to strip flesh off the bones of prey.

Although a cat’s jaws are short, they are extremely strong. They clamp down upon prey with enough power to crush the bones. The lower jaw is attached to the upper one by means of a simple hinge. This arrangement permits only up-and-down motion. A cat cannot move its lower jaw sideways, nor can it grind its teeth. When a cat clamps its jaws shut, the teeth mesh side by side and function like scissors. Cats thus tear and crush their food but do not chew it. Much of the food is swallowed whole, and digestive juices break it down further.

Perhaps among the most striking things about a cat are its litheness and grace of movement and the amazing flexibility of its body. It can with ease roll up into a ball, double up sideways, or stretch the back into almost a straight line. It can arch its back until the front and back legs are only a few inches apart. It can turn its body easily so that its tongue can reach the fur on the center of its back for grooming.

THE LEGS AND FEET
The cat’s legs appear short when compared with the length of the body, but they are powerful. Strong muscles produce instant power for leaping upon prey or for great bursts of speed to catch prey on the run. The sharp angles of the knee and “heel” of the hind legs also contribute to the power for sudden sprints, for climbing, and for jumping. The front legs are also powerful and extremely flexible. A cat can stretch its forelegs wide apart to hug the body of an enemy and hold it close. The forepaws can be tucked under the chest when the animal crouches, can be curved around the head when the animal washes behind the ears, and can be turned palm up for washing under and between the toes.

Unlike the dog and horse, the cat walks or runs by moving first the front and back legs on one side, then the front and back legs on the other side. Only the camel and the giraffe move in a similar way. Cats walk on their toes. Most have five toes in each forepaw, including one called a dewclaw a bit higher on the leg. Each hind paw generally has four toes. Some domestic cats have extra toes on the inner sides of the front feet or of all feet. This oddity, polydactylism, is an inherited dominant trait. Sailors once considered polydactyl cats to be lucky and took them along on their trade routes. This helped spread the cats to America. These cats are now common on the east coast of Canada and the United States and in western England and Wales. Polydactylism does not harm the cat or shorten its life.

cat's claws
A cat’s claws are formidable weapons for defense and for hunting. They also are useful tools for climbing and for clinging to precarious perches. Each toe is equipped with a claw, which grows from the last bone of the toe. In almost all cat species, the claws are hidden most of the time under skin. The skin protects the claws from injury and keeps them from becoming blunt as the animal walks. A cat sharpens them by clawing rough surfaces or by chewing at the tips. Domestic cats kept indoors will often claw furniture if a scratching post is not provided.

A cat’s retracted claw is held in its “sheath” by an elastic ligament. The moment a cat strikes, a muscle in the leg pulls on a tendon, which in turn pulls on the joint to which the claw is attached, and each claw comes out of its sheath. All claws can be unsheathed in a split second. The cheetah is the only kind of cat that cannot pull its claws completely back. Its claws, like those of the dog, are always exposed.

BEHAVIOR
Learn why only domestic cats purr and not other felines
While lions and other big cats can roar, domestic cats and some other small cats can purr. Purring may be very loud or so soft as to be inaudible to the human ear. Kittens may begin to purr a few days after birth. In all animals, vocal sounds come from vibrations of the vocal cords, which are in the voice box in the throat. No one knows exactly how the cat uses these to produce purring nor why no other kind of animal purrs. In addition to purring, cats make several different kinds of sounds—including meowing, chirping, hissing, yowling, and even growling.

Like many other mammals, cats like to play. Young cats stalk one another as make-believe enemies or prey and have play battles. Even old cats enjoy short periods of play. In play the animals practice the skills and techniques important for their survival. Cats are hunters and stalkers. Many games they play show their ability to creep close to prey, then swiftly spring upon it.

Cats have tiny erector muscles that are attached to hair follicles. These enable the cat to bristle all over. Thus, although the domestic cat is a relatively small animal, it can frighten enemies by arching its back, bristling, and hissing.

Most kinds of cats are skillful climbers, escaping into trees for safety or climbing to lie in wait for prey. The domestic cat climbs not only for safety but also for sport. It will streak up and down a tree or scale the draperies or furniture indoors with equal skill. Inexperienced kittens often dash up trees only to find that they do not know how to get down. A cat rarely falls from a tree. Given time, it will usually discover how to get down.

Domestic cats reproduce so prolifically that there are millions more cats than good homes. Female cats come into heat repeatedly and may become nervous or ill-tempered and lose weight if not permitted to mate. Males may wander restlessly, cry loudly to get out, and spray strong-smelling urine about the premises.

LIFE CYCLE

The young of domestic cats and other small cats are called kittens. The young of big cats such as lions, tigers, and leopards are known as cubs. Kittens or cubs may be born at any time of the year. Among wild cats, the time of birth depends upon the kind of cat and the climate of the area. Domestic cats in the tropics may have kittens at different times from those in northern climates. In the United States most domestic cat mothers have two litters a year, and kittens are born in the spring or late summer.

Wild cats have a longer gestation period (the time between conception and birth) than domestic cats. Most of the big cats are pregnant for about 100 days. A domestic cat is pregnant for about 63 to 65 days. As the time for birth approaches, the pregnant cat seeks a quiet, safe place to have her kittens in private. The domestic cat’s owner may provide a towel-lined basket or even a cardboard box for the cat to give birth. However, the cat will often decide on her own where she is most comfortable to give birth.

Most kittens are born headfirst, but some may be reversed. The average litter consists of four kittens, but there may be only one or as many as seven. The birthing process for domestic cats usually takes about two hours. Each kitten is enclosed in a thin transparent sac that is generally broken open at the moment of birth. If it is not, the mother immediately breaks it and removes it with her teeth and tongue. The newborn kitten weighs about 3.5 to 5 ounces (100 to 142 grams) and is about 3 inches (8 centimeters) long.

Most domestic cats need little assistance while giving birth. However, many are comforted by the presence of their owners. Occasionally the sac will be tough, and the mother may be unable to break it. If this happens, the owner should break it, as the kitten may suffocate.

At birth kittens and cubs have no teeth. The eyes are closed, and the fur is soft and downy. They begin to get their first teeth when they are two or three weeks old, and the rest grow in within the first few months. The baby teeth of domestic cats are replaced with permanent teeth by about five months of age. It usually takes longer for big cats to get their permanent teeth.

The eyes begin to open when the kitten or cub is about 8 to 12 days old. All newborn cats’ eyes are blue. It may take several months for the eyes to change to their permanent color. Kittens begin to crawl out of their nest when they are about a month old, and cubs start leaving the den by about two months. The rate of growth and the ultimate size and weight of the animal depend greatly on inheritance and nutrition. Most six-month-old domestic cats weigh about 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms). They reach full skeletal development by the time they are about a year old. Female domestic cats usually become sexually mature when they are six to eight months old, and males become sexually active a few months later. In contrast, six-month old male tiger cubs weigh about 90 to 100 pounds (40–45 kilograms). Females weigh considerably less. Male tigers become sexually mature at about four or five years of age and females about three or four years of age.

cat: determining the sex
To prevent undesired kittens, domestic cats can be neutered. In the male, the testes are removed. In the female, the ovaries and uterus are removed, which is also called spaying. A veterinarian must perform both procedures. Many veterinarians traditionally recommend that neutering take place at about five or six months of age. However, cats can be spayed or neutered as early as six to eight weeks of age. Older cats can also undergo the operation. Neutered cats may need to have their food intake reduced to keep them from gaining weight.

Neutered cats live longer than nonneutered ones, partly because they have less desire to roam. Well-cared-for, neutered domestic cats may live into their teens. Some may reach their 20s, and a few have been reported to live into their 30s.

CATS AS PETS
BREEDS
Domestic cats are either purebreds or mixed breeds. The number of recognized show breeds that have defined, inherited characteristics has increased dramatically since the late 1950s as cats have become more popular home companions. Many organizations that register cats recognize between 40 and 60 distinctive breeds. These organizations include the Cat Fanciers’ Association in the United States, the Fédération Internationale Féline in Luxembourg, and the World Cat Federation, which is headquartered in Germany. The large International Cat Association, with headquarters in the United States, recognizes more than 70 breeds.

Almost everyone recognizes the words Siamese, Manx, and Persian as the names for certain breeds of cats. Until about a century ago, however, these terms had little meaning. Domestic cats bred freely as they spread through various parts of the world. As a result, cats of almost infinite varieties of sizes, shapes, and colors came into being. Some cat owners liked the qualities of certain strains and wanted to perpetuate them. They interbred the cats with the desired qualities. When these qualities continued to appear in generation after generation of cats (that is, when they bred true or pure), a new breed was established.

Cat breeders today follow essentially the same pattern. They consider a strain that breeds true for at least three generations a purebred, and proof of this true breeding is necessary before a new breed becomes accepted. Cat fanciers in different parts of the world recognize different breeds.

BODY AND COAT TYPE
Perhaps the most easily identifiable differences among the various breeds of domestic cats are in the length and color of the coat and in the variations of eye color. The majority of cats that are not purebred have short hair. Those with long hair have acquired it as the result of the crossbreeding of their ancestors with purebred long-haired cats. The body form of nonpurebreds varies from slender, rangy types with somewhat elongated heads to stocky, thickset animals with short heads that are somewhat like those of the Persian cats. These differences in body type are most pronounced among the various purebreds, ranging from slender Siamese to stocky longhairs.

COAT COLOR
Among the cats that are not purebreds, the brown striped and blotched cats most closely resemble their wild African and European ancestors. This striped and blotched pattern is properly called tabby, but popularly known as tiger. It occurs in various shades. Among these are red (orange), cream, blue (gray), brown, silver, and smoke. Solid white is the rarest, though genetically it is dominant over other colors. Solid black and solid blue (gray) are relatively rare. Almost without exception, the solid blacks have a few white hairs under the throat and shoulder. The solid colors occasionally show faint striping on the legs and tail. Many cats have white markings. Some of these are handsomely symmetrical, but others are distributed irregularly and sometimes create a quaint or even comical effect.

Black-and-orange cats are called tortoiseshells. Blue-creams are a diluted version of black and orange. Some cats that are black and orange or blue and cream also have white markings. Those cats are said to be tricolors, calicoes, or money cats. The black-orange (or blue-cream) color-determining genes are linked to the female sex chromosomes. For this reason tortoiseshell males and tricolor males are produced only as the result of abnormal chromosome arrangements that occurred in one or both parents. Such abnormal arrangements often lead to infertility, and the males may not be able to reproduce. In other words, tortoiseshells and tricolors of breed standards are very difficult to produce by controlled breeding.

BREED ORGANIZATIONS
Recognition and acceptance of a breed usually must come from an established group of cat fanciers. Groups of breeders and other persons interested in showing cats have formed organizations to establish rules for shows and standards by which cats can be judged at the shows. They also keep studbooks and validate the registration papers needed for purebred cats. In most countries there is only one organization that acts as the governing body. In the United States there are many, each of which sets its own judging standards and rules. The two largest of these are the Cat Fanciers’ Association and the American Cat Fanciers Association. The International Cat Association has its headquarters in the United States.

In most parts of the United States there are many organizations to which people interested in cats may belong. Some of these are affiliated with national associations, but many are strictly local clubs that invite the participation of anyone in the neighborhood. Membership in the large clubs usually consists chiefly of breeders and owners of purebred cats. Such organizations serve as clearinghouses for providing information about specific breeds and giving members advice about breeding methods. They also help establish standards for breeds. Most of the organizations conduct shows in which competitions for championships are held. Cat fanciers take their animals to vie with others in their breed or class for top honors. Nonpurebred cats may also be shown in the household-pet class. These cat shows are extremely popular.

CHOOSING AND CARING FOR A PET CAT
Before taking any kind of pet into a home, the prospective owners must be sure they are willing to accept full responsibility for the care and well-being of the animal. Although cats are less demanding than some other kinds of pets, they do need attention and care.

PUREBRED OR MIXED BREED
The old term alley cat has been replaced with the term mixed-breed cat. Mixed-breed cats may be either long-haired or short-haired. Short-haired mixed breeds are the most common types. Among the shorthairs, the tabby, or tiger-striped, cats are prominent.

People who wish to breed cats for profit should choose a purebred cat. The animal should be obtained directly from breeders, who should supply pedigree and registration papers. Purebred cats usually are kept indoors because of their value and the risk of accident or theft. For this reason, most owners prefer the less valuable—and sometimes hardier—mixed-breed cat.

People can obtain mixed-breed cats from a variety of sources. Sometimes friends or neighbors have cats that they do not want anymore or cats that have had kittens. Some local veterinarians will take in stray cats and kittens until they can find them a new home. Animal shelters are another source for finding cats and other animals. Whatever the source, the cats should appear healthy and their environment clean. Overcrowding can lead to the spread of disease.

KITTEN OR CAT
Almost all kittens are adorable, but all grow up. Owners will need to care for the cats when they are grown as well. In choosing a kitten, look for one that is lively, friendly, and gentle. The body should be plump, the coat clean, and the eyes and nose free from discharges. If the mother is present, observe her temperament to see if she is comfortable around people. The older a cat is when you adopt it, the more you will know of its temperament and personality. Depending on the cat, even a mature animal may adjust well.

ADJUSTING TO A NEW HOME
Cats that have never known the pleasures of the outdoors make excellent indoor pets. Those that have gone in and out freely since infancy may adjust poorly if required to live strictly indoors.

When a cat is taken into a new home it should be allowed time to adjust to its new surroundings and to humans and other pets with which the cat will be living. Since this experience can be overwhelming for most cats, introductions to individuals, to strange surroundings, and to other pets should be gradual. While cats of all ages are quite curious, older cats that are put into new surroundings can be very frightened. They often react by seeking out a hiding place and may well remain there for many hours—perhaps more than a day. The kitten, having had little chance to become acclimated to one place, will take a great deal of time inspecting a new home. It will take less time, however, in making itself at home.

FEEDING YOUR PET
Domestic cats that can hunt extensively provide themselves with a good diet, but many domestic cats rarely hunt. Their diet combines commercial pet foods and table scraps in varying degrees. Ideally, cats should have a diet similar to that of their wild relatives. However, like all meat-eating animals, cats ingest grass and other plants occasionally, and small quantities of vegetables may serve as both a laxative and a hair ball remover.

Cats thrive on meat, but an all-meat diet is unbalanced and will lead to various nutritional diseases. Cats derive nutrients, including moisture, from their entire prey—hence the low thirst drive of most cats. Commercial dry pet foods lack moisture and are overloaded with starches. These products are convenient for the owner but can contribute to ailments such as obesity, urinary tract diseases, and diabetes mellitus. A cat’s system is not equipped to handle a high intake of carbohydrates or to digest grains. It is therefore important to examine the ingredient list on commercial cat foods, which often add ingredients that have no logical place in a cat’s diet. In addition, seafood is not recommended. Many cats are allergic to it, and it may be contaminated with hazardous chemicals.

GROOMING
Most cats never need a bath. A cat is naturally fastidiously clean and spends much time grooming.

All cats, however—short-haired as well as long-haired—need regular brushing. This prevents the fur from matting and removes loose hair that might be licked off and form hair balls in the animal’s digestive tract.

TRAINING
Virtually all kittens are born with a strong instinct for cleanliness and soon learn to use a litter pan. The litter should have waste removed from it daily, and the pan should be washed frequently with mild soap and rinsed well with boiling water.

Most kittens make friends easily—even with dogs. There are many instances of unusual attachments between cats and a variety of other creatures including cows, chickens, rabbits, rats, and horses. Despite firm attempts at training, however, few cats can be trusted alone in the vicinity of pet birds or fish.

SOME DISEASES OF CATS
A good veterinarian is of primary importance to any pet owner. Cat owners should choose a veterinarian who is interested in cats and has treated them successfully. If a cat seems ill, the owners should call a veterinarian at once for advice. They should never try to diagnose a disease or treat the animal on their own.

The most widespread and serious infectious disease of cats is panleukopenia (also called feline distemper or infectious enteritis). Its onset is sudden and severe, with reduced activity, fever, loss of appetite, and vomiting. Every cat should be immunized to protect against this disease. The first vaccination is usually given when the animal is about 10 weeks old, and boosters should be given annually.

Upper respiratory infections are exceedingly common, and the best-known are pneumonitis and rhinotracheitis. Symptoms resemble those of the common cold in humans and distemper in dogs. These viral illnesses, however, cannot be passed on to humans or dogs although they are highly infectious for other cats. Vaccines are effective against these infections as well as against feline leukemia, a virus that causes fatal illness in domestic cats.

Rabies is an invariably fatal viral disease. It is transmitted by the bite of a rabid animal. Rabies has become established among the wild animals in many parts of the world. A cat that roams outdoors in an area where rabies occurs may be bitten by a rabid animal. It is therefore advisable that all cats in such areas be given preventive vaccinations.

A cat that swallows large amounts of hair while grooming may develop hair, or fur, balls. Occasionally these may cause ulcers or completely obstruct the digestive tract. Prevention, in the form of frequent combing and brushing, is best. If hair balls occur in spite of grooming, owners can give cats special food or treats formulated to prevent hair balls or to help the cats pass them through their systems. Over-the-counter gels or even short-term use of petroleum jelly dabbed on a cat’s paws can help get rid of hair balls. The cat licks and ingests the gel, which helps to lubricate the digestive system and thus helps the cat expel the hair ball. Although once a common treatment, mineral oil should not be used because the cat can inhale it, which may lead to serious injury.

Many apparently normal cats have tiny mineral crystals in their urine. For reasons not yet fully understood, these crystals often clump together to form sandlike particles or small stones, which may cause irritation or obstruction of the urinary passages. A urinary obstruction is a grave emergency and must be treated immediately by a veterinarian.

Ear irritations are most often caused by mites, which are tiny parasites about as large as the point of a pin. The insides of the ears look as though they are filled with a dry brown dirt. The cat shakes its head often and may scratch the outside of the ears and neck persistently. A few drops of any mild oil massaged into the ear canal suffocates the mites and loosens the dirt, which may then be removed with cotton-tipped sticks.

Any cat may get fleas. These small jumping insects live in the cat’s fur and suck blood through the animal’s skin. Products for treatment are readily available. However, people should use only a preparation labeled safe for cats, and they should use it strictly as directed.

Worms are a common intestinal parasite of cats. An owner should never try to deworm a cat without the advice of a veterinarian. There are several different types of worms, each requiring a different kind of drug for control.

Ringworm, a fungal skin disease, is probably the only infection that is clearly and commonly passed from cats to humans. Simple sanitary measures such as keeping pets off the table and washing the hands after handling a cat eliminate most possible risks.

Cats may be poisoned by a variety of substances. They may eat poisonous plants—which include rhododendron, hyacinth, poinsettia, and ivy. Waxes, cleaning fluids, disinfectants, detergents, and mothballs may be toxic or irritating. Antifreeze, weed killers, insecticides, and rodent poisons are outdoor hazards. Cats react adversely to many chemicals and drugs, such as aspirin or iodine, that are safe for humans or other animals. They should never be given medicines not labeled safe for cats or prescribed by a veterinarian.

THE CAT IN HISTORY
No one knows exactly when or how the cat first appeared on Earth. Most paleontologists agree, however, that the cat’s most ancient ancestor probably belonged to a genus of weasellike carnivores called Miacis, which lived about 60 million years ago.

Scientists believe that Miacis is the common ancestor of all land-dwelling carnivores, including dogs as well as cats. Perhaps best-known of the prehistoric cats is Smilodon, the saber-toothed cat sometimes called a tiger. This formidable animal hunted throughout much of the world but became extinct. Cats have continued with remarkably little change into modern times.

CATS IN THE ANCIENT WORLD
The first associations of cats with humans may have begun toward the end of the Stone Age. It took many centuries, however, for the cat to become established as a domestic animal. About 5,000 years ago cats were accepted members of the households of ancient Egypt. Many of the breeds we now know have evolved from these ancient cats. The Egyptians used the cat to hunt birds as well as to destroy the rats and mice that infested the grain stocks along the Nile River. The cat was considered so valuable that laws protected it, and eventually a cult of cat worship developed that lasted for more than 2,000 years. The cat goddess Bastet became one of the most sacred of all figures of worship. She was represented with the head of a cat. Soon all cats became sacred to the Egyptians, and they were well cared for.

Many ancient Egyptians would mummify a cat’s body after its death. They would then bury it with its owner so that the two could be together in the afterlife. Sometimes people mummified cats and buried them in special cemeteries as offerings to Bastet.

Cats have long been known to other cultures as well. Wall tiles in Crete dating from 1600 bc depict hunting cats. The cat was present in Greece from the 5th century bc and appeared in China from 500 bc. In India cats were mentioned in Sanskrit writings from about 100 bc, while the Arabs and the Japanese were not introduced to the cat until about ad 600. The earliest record of cats in Britain dates to about ad 936, when a prince of south-central Wales enacted laws for their protection.

CATS IN THE MEDIEVAL WORLD
Cats were not nearly so well-regarded in Europe during the Middle Ages. They became objects of superstitions and were associated with evil. Many people associated the cat with sorcery and witchcraft. People who kept cats were suspected of wickedness and were often put to death along with their cats. Cats were hunted, tortured, and sacrificed. On religious feast days, large numbers of cats were sometimes burned alive as part of the celebrations. Live cats were sealed inside the walls of houses and other buildings as they were being constructed, in the belief that this would bring good luck. As the cat population dwindled, the disease-carrying rat population increased, a factor that contributed greatly to the spread of plagues and other epidemics throughout Europe.

By the 17th century the cat had begun to regain its former place as a companion to people and a controller of rodents. Cardinal Richelieu, in France, was noted for his love of cats. Many writers, particularly in France and England, began to keep cats as pets and to write of their good qualities. It became fashionable to own and breed cats, especially the long-haired varieties. By the late 1800s people were organizing cat shows in England and the United States and establishing cat fanciers’ organizations. Many of the superstitions that arose during the period of cat persecution, however, are still evident today in the form of such sayings as “A black cat crossing your path brings bad luck.”

CATS IN THE ARTS
The cat has been a favorite subject of artists and writers for centuries. Perhaps best-known of all artistic representations are those of the Egyptian cat goddess Bastet. Ancient sculptures and drawings of her image with the head of a cat have been found in many places in the Nile River valley. Japanese artists excelled in portraying the cat. Some of the drawings were so realistic that in ancient times they were thought to be magic. People believed that if the drawings themselves were hung in homes and in temples they kept rats and mice away. Among the most charming of Japanese cats is Maneki-Neko, a small cat believed to ensure happiness and good luck. Japanese Buddhists venerate cats after death, and Gotoku Temple in Tokyo is dedicated to them.

Cats have been portrayed in the works of many great artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Paul Gauguin, Théodore Géricault, William Hogarth, Édouard Manet, and Pablo Picasso. One of the best-known cats in the world at one time was Felix the Cat, star of animated cartoon films. Other famous cartoon cats include Krazy Kat, Tom (of Tom and Jerry), and Garfield. Musicians such as Maurice Ravel have also paid homage to the cat in compositions.

Fables and tales about cats are part of the culture of most peoples. Versions of the Puss in Boots fable occur in almost every language, and the personality and beauty of cats has inspired many poets. The poems in T.S. Eliot’s collection Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats (1939) in turn inspired Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Broadway musical Cats (1981). Readers of all ages enjoy books about cats.

INTRODUCTION 
Himalayan cat
cat, (Felis catus), also called house cat or domestic cat,  domesticated member of the family Felidae, order Carnivora, and the smallest member of that family. Like all felids, domestic cats are characterized by supple low-slung bodies, finely molded heads, long tails that aid in balance, and specialized teeth and claws that adapt them admirably to a life of active hunting. Cats possess other features of their wild relatives in being basically carnivorous, remarkably agile and powerful, and finely coordinated in movement.

It is noteworthy that the ancestors of the other common household pet, the dog, were social animals that lived together in packs in which there was subordination to a leader, and the dog has readily transferred its allegiance from pack leader to human master. The cat, however, has not yielded as readily to subjugation. Consequently, the house cat is able to revert to complete self-reliance more quickly and more successfully than most domesticated dogs. For an account of the relationship of the family of cats to other carnivores, see carnivore.

ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF CATS
The “cat pattern,” established very early in the evolution of modern mammals, was a successful one: early cats were already typical in form at a time when the ancestors of most other modern mammalian types were scarcely recognizable. They first appeared in the early Pliocene Epoch (5.3 to 3.6 million years ago), and they have continued with remarkably little change into modern times.

DOMESTICATION

ancestors of the domestic cat
Although the origin of the domesticated cat is hidden in antiquity, studies involving mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) suggest that there have been two lineages of Felis catus. One lineage (F. silvestris silvestris) appeared in Asia Minor possibly as early as 6,400 years ago and dispersed northward and westward into Europe. The other lineage appeared in Egypt sometime between 6,400 and 1,000 years ago before spreading throughout the Mediterranean (possibly through human introduction) along paths that paralleled the region’s trade routes. Cats of both lineages continued to breed with the African wildcat (F. silvestris lybica) during their respective dispersals.

hollyhocks and cats
The earliest known association between cats and humans dates possibly as far back as the origins of agriculture in the Middle East, about 9,500 years ago. A cat skeleton accompanying that of a human dated to that time was discovered in southern Cyprus. Although some sources note that this finding suggests that cats had undergone some degree of domestication in that location, other sources (citing evidence that the cat genome did not differ that much from that of the African wildcat during this period) argue that cats may have domesticated themselves by choosing to live in human-altered landscapes. Fossil evidence found in China dating to approximately 5,300 years ago revealed that cats similar in size to modern domestic cats fed on small grain-eating animals, such as rodents, and millet in agricultural settings. Although research suggests that these cats were actually leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis), which were replaced by modern domestic cats (F. catus) before 3000 bce, this discovery suggests that humans allowed cats to hunt mice and other rodents that threatened grain stores and possibly fed the cats or allowed them to consume leftover food.

Although the cat was proclaimed a sacred animal in Egypt in the 5th and 6th dynasties (c. 2465–c. 2150 bce), it had not necessarily been domesticated at that time. It is probable that the ancient Egyptians partnered with the cat because they realized its value in protecting granaries from rodents. Their affection and respect for this predator led to the development of religious cat cults and temple worship of cats. There are no authentic records of domestication earlier than 1500 bce, however.

Cats have long been known to other cultures. Wall tiles in Crete dating from 1600 bce depict hunting cats. Evidence from art and literature indicates that the cat was present in Greece from the 5th century bce, and tiles featuring cats appeared in China from 500 bce. In India cats were mentioned in Sanskrit writings around 100 bce, while the Arabs and the Japanese were not introduced to the cat until about 600 ce. The earliest record of cats in Britain dates to about 936 ce, when Howel Dda, prince of south-central Wales, enacted laws for their protection.

Persian cat
Manx cat
Sphynx cat
Even though all cats are similar in appearance, it is difficult to trace the ancestry of individual breeds. Since tabbylike markings appear in the drawings and mummies of ancient Egyptian cats, present-day tabbies may be descendants of the sacred cats of Egypt. The Abyssinian also resembles pictures and statues of Egyptian cats. The Persian, whose colouring is often the same as that of mixed breeds (although the length of hair and the body conformation are distinctive), was probably crossed at various times with other breeds. The tailless Manx cat, like the hairless Sphynx cat and curly-coated Devon Rex, is a mutation. The ancestry of Persian and Siamese cats may well be distinct from that of other domestic breeds, representing a domestication of an Asian wild cat. In fact, nothing is known of the ancestry of the Siamese types, and there is no living species of Asian cat that could have served as ancestor.

ASSOCIATIONS WITH HUMAN CULTURE
The cat has long played a role in religion and witchcraft. In the Bible, “cat” is mentioned only in the apocryphal Letter of Jeremiah. The cat figured prominently in the religions of Egypt, the Norse countries, and various parts of Asia. The Egyptians had a cat-headed goddess named Bast (or Bastet). Thousands of cat mummies have been discovered in Egypt, and there were even mouse mummies, presumably to provide food for the cats. Often the cat has been associated with sorcery and witchcraft, and the superstitions regarding cats are innumerable. Throughout the ages, cats have been more cruelly mistreated than perhaps any other animal. Black cats in particular have long been regarded as having occult powers and as being the familiars of witches.

Dick Whittington and his cat
The cat is a familiar figure in nursery rhymes, stories, and proverbs. The English legend of Dick Whittington and his cat is a particular favourite. The writers Théophile Gautier and Charles Baudelaire paid it homage, and in the 20th century Rudyard Kipling, Colette, and T.S. Eliot wrote of cats, and British composer Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber created the popular stage production Cats.

GENERAL FEATURES AND SPECIAL ADAPTATIONS
black cat
The average weight of the household cat varies from 2.7 to 4.5 kg (6 to 10 pounds), although, among nonpedigreed cats, weights up to 12.7 kg (28 pounds) are not uncommon. Average lengths are 71.1 cm (28 inches) for males and 50.8 cm (20 inches) for females. In keeping with a carnivorous habit, the cat has a simple gut; the small intestine is only about three times the length of the body.

The skin of the cat, composed of dermis and epidermis, regenerates and fights off infection quickly. Tiny erector muscles, attached to hair follicles, enable the cat to bristle all over. Thus, although the cat is a relatively small animal, it can frighten enemies by arching its back, bristling, and hissing.

COORDINATION AND MUSCULATURE
Cats are among the most highly specialized of the flesh-eating mammals. Their brains are large and well developed. Cats are digitigrade; that is, they walk on their toes. Unlike the dog and horse, the cat walks or runs by moving first the front and back legs on one side, then the front and back legs on the other side; only the camel and the giraffe move in a similar way. The cat’s body has great elasticity. Because the vertebrae of the spinal column are held together by muscles rather than by ligaments, as in humans, the cat can elongate or contract its back, curve it upward, or oscillate it along the vertebral line. The construction of the shoulder joints permits the cat to turn its foreleg in almost any direction. Cats are powerfully built animals and are so well coordinated that they almost invariably land on their feet if they fall or are dropped.

TEETH
The cat’s teeth are adapted to three functions: stabbing (canines), anchoring (canines), and cutting (molars). Cats have no flat-crowned crushing teeth and therefore cannot chew their food; instead, they cut it up. Except for the canines and molars, the cat’s teeth are more or less nonfunctional; most of the cheek teeth do not even meet when the mouth is closed. The dental formula in all cats, for either side of both upper and lower jaws, is incisors 3/3, canines 1/1, premolars 3/2, and molars 1/1. The total number of teeth is 16 in the upper jaw and 14 in the lower. Primary, or milk, teeth number 24; these are replaced by the permanent teeth at about five months. Each half of the jaw is hinged to the skull by a transverse roller that fits tightly into a trough on the underside of the skull, making grinding movements impossible even if the cat had teeth suitable for grinding.

CLAWS
There is a remarkable mechanism for retracting the cat’s claws when they are not in use. The claw is retracted or extended by pivoting the end bone of the toe, which bears the claw, over the tip of the next bone. The action that unsheathes the claws also spreads the toes widely, making the foot more than twice as broad as it normally is and converting it into a truly formidable weapon. This claw-sheathing mechanism is present in all species of the cat family except the cheetah. Although there are no nerve endings in the nail itself, blood capillaries are present in the inner part.

SENSES
Cats are generally nocturnal in habit. The retina of the cat’s eye is made extra sensitive to light by a layer of guanine, which causes the eye to shine at night in a strong light. The eyes themselves, large with pupils that expand or contract to mere slits according to the density of light, do not distinguish colours clearly. Cats have a third eyelid, or nictitating membrane, commonly called the haw. Its appearance is used frequently as an indicator of the cat’s general state of health.

The cat’s sense of smell, particularly well developed in the adult, is crucial to its evaluation of food, so that a cat whose nasal passages become clogged as a result of illness may appear to lose its appetite completely. Cats can distinguish the odour of nitrogenous substances (e.g., fish) especially keenly.

The sense of touch is acute in cats. The eyebrows, whiskers, hairs of the cheek, and fine tufts of hair on the ears are all extremely sensitive to vibratory stimulation. The functions of the whiskers (vibrissae) are only partially understood; however, it is known that, if they are cut off, the cat is temporarily incapacitated. The toes and paws, as well as the tip of the nose, are also very sensitive to touch.

Cats also have an acute sense of hearing. Their ears contain almost 30 muscles (compared with 6 in humans); as a result, they can turn them many times more quickly in the direction of a sound than can a dog. The ears of cats are receptive to ultrasonic frequencies up to 85,000 vibrations per second, greatly exceeding the hearing capabilities of dogs, which register 35,000 vibrations per second.

BEHAVIOUR
SPECIAL TRAITS
grooming
The cat has a subtle repertoire of facial expressions, vocal sounds, and tail and body postures that express its emotional state and intentions. These various signals serve to increase, decrease, or maintain social distance. One distinctive social behaviour involves rubbing the side of the head, lips, chin, or tail against the owner and against furniture. These regions of the cat’s body contain scent glands that seem to play a role in establishing a familiar odour in the cat’s environment.

The tongue of all cats, which has a patch of sharp, backward-directed spines called filiform papillae near the tip, has the appearance and feel of a coarse file; the spines help the cat to groom itself. The disposition to cleanliness is well established in cats, and they groom themselves at length, especially after meals.

Learn why only domestic cats purr and not other felines
While lions and other big cats roar, domestic cats and other Felis species purr. Purring has been described as a low, continuous, rattling hum and often is interpreted as an expression of pleasure or contentment. Purring also occurs in cats that are injured and in pain, however, so that this vocalization can be seen as the cat’s “mantra”—that is, as a relaxing, self-comforting sound and a friendly mood-conveying signal.

BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS
Under conditions of domestication, the cat is subject to a variety of factors that result in behaviour indicative of emotional distress and difficulty in adapting to the home environment. Some behaviours are not abnormal but are difficult for owners to accept.

The most common behaviour problem in companion cats is that they sometimes urinate and defecate outside the litter box in the house. Organic causes include feline urologic syndrome (urinary bladder inflammation and calculi, or stones, in the urinary tract), blocked or impacted anal glands, and constipation. Emotional causes include the addition of a new family member—another cat, a child, or a spouse. Such changes may make the cat feel insecure, so that it deposits urine and feces around the house, possibly as territorial marks for security. Cats are creatures of habit, and any change in the family structure or in daily routines—resulting, for example, from a move or even from rearranging furniture—can be stressful.

Another common behaviour problem in cats is their natural desire to rake objects such as drapes and furniture with their claws. Surgical removal of the front claws to prevent property damage is normally repugnant to cat lovers. Cats can be trained to use carpeted scratching posts in the house to satisfy this behavioral need, which may be a combination of claw cleaning and sharpening and of territorial marking.

Many cats engage in social licking and in the grooming of their feline and human companions, which is a natural display of affection and dependence. Some also engage in nursing behaviour, sucking on people’s fingers and earlobes, on their own paws and tails, and on blankets and woolen clothing. Nursing may be a cat’s way of regressing and relaxing into kittenish behaviour. It is often more intense in cats weaned too early or in those malnourished in kittenhood. For various emotional reasons some cats may groom themselves to the point of self-mutilation or become compulsive wool suckers and eaters.

Pica—a hunger for nonnutritive substances—may be a symptom of the need for more roughage in the diet or of feline leukemia or other health problems. As with the dog, excessive eating and drinking is frequently associated with endocrine diseases such as diabetes and thyroid dysfunction. Cats often vomit soon after eating, which is most often caused by the accumulation of fur balls in the stomach, although a food allergy, feline leukemia, or other organic cause may be involved.

Active and healthy cats often race through the house as though they were crazed. These “evening crazies” (which can also erupt early in the morning) result from the cat’s ancient rhythm of actively hunting around dawn and dusk. In the domestic environment, this normal, instinctive behaviour often still occurs, to the consternation of some owners who fear that their cat may have rabies, a brain tumour, or an unstable personality.

Changes in animals’ behaviour should not, therefore, be dismissed as psychological (or as simple disobedience, as when a cat suddenly becomes unhousebroken, for example), since there may be an underlying physical cause. Nevertheless, abnormal behaviour in animals often does have a nonphysical, psychological, or emotional origin, which should always be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of the ailments of companion animals.

OTHER TRAITS
The cat’s sleep patterns are different from those of dogs and humans. Dogs and humans have long periods of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, the stage that is associated with dreaming. In contrast, the cat rarely lapses into REM sleep. Instead, it has a lighter, episodic sleep pattern that enables it to rest but to be instantly alert. When sick, cats have a tendency to withdraw and become inactive, which helps them conserve energy. A sick cat may seem lifeless but recover after a few days of withdrawal, which is one reason cats are said to have nine lives. (A sick cat should always be taken to a veterinarian, however; it is negligent simply to let nature take its course.)

Cats are known to have traveled hundreds of miles to find their owners in new homes to which they themselves have never been. Dogs have also performed such feats of so-called psi (psychic) trailing. Scientists have not been able to find a physiological or psychological explanation for this ability.

CATS AS PETS
The popularity of the cat, especially of pedigreed breeds, has continued to grow. The cat’s independent personality, grace, cleanliness, and subtle displays of affection have wide appeal. Typically, cats are creatures of habit; they are inquisitive, but not adventurous, and are easily upset by sudden changes of routine. The ideal household cat has been separated from its mother between the ages of two and four months, raised in a clean home, kept away from unhealthy animals, and inoculated against common infectious cat diseases. Although cats often enjoy the company of other cats, especially when raised together from kittenhood, introducing a strange cat to other cats in the home can cause stress, aggression, and other behaviour problems. Cats are generally less sociable than dogs, who more readily accept a new pack member.

A good disposition and good health are important criteria for choosing a cat. Disposition varies only slightly between male and female cats. There are, however, distinct differences in disposition among the various pedigreed varieties; the Siamese, for example, is vocal and demanding, while the Persian is quiet and fastidious. The mixed breed, or “alley cat,” is a heterogeneous breed of unknown lineage; therefore, its disposition is difficult to assess. By chance, the mixed breed may prove a happier and healthier pet than a pedigreed one. On the other hand, the behaviour and vigour of the direct ancestors of pedigreed cats are indicative of the characteristics the offspring will possess as adults. But, as with the propagation of purebred dogs, the proliferation of pedigreed cats has resulted in an increase in inherited diseases, a major reason many people prefer mongrels or mixed breeds.

NUTRITION
Cats should have a diet similar to that of their wild relatives. They are adapted by nature to be flesh eaters, as is shown by their alimentary tract and their dentition. The cat uses its canines to catch and kill prey, the molars to cut it up. Lack of flat-surfaced teeth prevents it from chewing or gnawing. The cat has a short intestine, and its stomach secretes digestive juices that act primarily on meat. Cats, however, like all meat-eating animals, ingest grass and other plants occasionally, and small quantities of vegetables may serve as both a laxative and a hair ball remover.

As cats are the strictest of all carnivorous mammals, they thrive on meat, but an all-meat diet is unbalanced and will lead to various nutritional deficiency diseases. Cats derive nutrients, including moisture, from their entire prey—hence the low thirst drive of most cats. Commercial dry pet foods, lacking moisture and overloaded with starches, are convenient for the owner but can contribute to many of the most common feline ailments—including obesity, urinary tract diseases, and diabetes mellitus. An obligate carnivore’s system is not equipped to handle a high dietary proportion of carbohydrates or to digest grain matter (see nutrition: Carnivores). It is therefore prudent to examine the ingredient list on commercial cat foods, including “prescription” foods, which often contain species-inappropriate ingredients that have no logical place in a cat’s diet. In addition, seafood is not recommended; many cats are allergic to it, and it may be contaminated with hazardous chemicals.

Getting as close to the natural carnivorous diet as possible by feeding a low-carbohydrate, meat-based diet can eliminate many of the most common ailments and diseases, which are not only painful for cats but also quite costly. Feline experts advise against ever feeding cats all-dry manufactured foods, because cats often grow to prefer those to the degree that they refuse other, healthier foods.

REPRODUCTION
Cats reach reproductive age between 7 and 12 months. A breeding female (called a queen) can be in heat, or estrus, as many as five times a year. During these periods, which last about five days, the cat “calls,” or caterwauls, intermittently. The gestation period for cats averages 63 to 65 days, and birth usually lasts about two hours. The birth is often called kittening, and the kittens are called a litter. The average litter numbers four; however, the Abyssinian usually has fewer, the Siamese more.

Each kitten is born in a separate amniotic sac that is generally broken open at the moment of birth. If it is not, the mother breaks it. She also severs the umbilical cord and eats the placenta (which in many cases stimulates lactation). The kittens are born blind, deaf, and helpless, as are many other carnivores; their senses begin to function 10 or 12 days after birth. Soon after birth the mother licks her kittens; this action cleans them and helps stimulate their circulation. Kittens at birth lack distinctive colouring, and many do not acquire their characteristic markings and colour for weeks. For example, Siamese kittens are white at birth, while blue Persians have tabby markings and black Persians are brown.

Unlike wild cats that breed once a year, the domestic cat is capable of bearing up to three litters every year. Traditionally, regulation of the cat population was accomplished by the selective killing of the newborn. In modern times, however, sterilization—by means of relatively safe and simple operations known as spaying, neutering, or altering—has become common in affluent societies. Neutering is also viewed as an adaptive measure for indoor life.

Castration of the male, ideally around six or seven months of age, helps control the adult male’s tendency to “spray”—to mark objects in and around the house with his own urine. Spaying the female may help reduce the incidence of breast cancer in addition to eliminating uterine diseases and unwanted litters.

Neutered cats live longer than nonneutered ones, partly because they have less desire to roam. The average life expectancy for the cat is 10 to 15 years; the oldest cat on record attained the age of 38 years.

DISEASES AND PARASITES
For many years cat treatments were simply extensions of those given dogs. Now, however, cat disorders of the skin, the eyes, the ears, the various systems (circulatory, respiratory, urinary, digestive, nervous, skeletal), and the blood, as well as contagious cat diseases and external and internal parasites, are studied, so that appropriate preventions and treatments can be developed.

Many cats die because their ailments become serious before their general conditions change sufficiently to reveal symptoms of illness. On the other hand, many symptoms used in diagnosing cat ailments are not definitive for given disorders. For example, signs of illness include general symptoms such as a dull coat, lack of appetite, and listlessness. Diarrhea may be a result of serious illness or simply reflect a change in diet. Tearing of the eyes, especially when accompanied by sneezing, may indicate conjunctivitis or a cold. Since, however, sneezing is the cat’s only mechanism for blowing its nose, not all sneezing indicates illness. Open sores, usually at the base of the ear, around the mouth, or on the toes, can point to an ear mite or a ringworm infection or to a fight with another animal.

Cats are attacked by several kinds of external and internal parasites. External parasites are most generally found in kittens, although they can occur in adults. The most frequent parasites are fleas, but lice, ticks, and ear mites also occur. Internal parasites include roundworms, tapeworms, and protozoan coccidia. Modern veterinary medicine has made all of these easy to control.

Panleucopenia, often called feline distemper, is the best-known viral disease in cats. Highly contagious, with a high mortality rate, it is seen most often in young cats. Vaccines are effective protective measures. Rabies is less of a problem with cats than with dogs, but all free-roaming cats should be vaccinated. Vaccines have also been developed for other feline diseases, including feline leukemia, pneumonitis (chlamydiosis), viral rhinotracheitis (cat influenza), and calicivirus infections.

Cats permitted to wander outdoors are exposed to a variety of hazards, including accidents, attacks from other animals, poisoning, fleas and other parasites, and contagious diseases such as feline acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Cats that kill and eat rodents and other small animals can become infected with the parasitic protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, which can be transmitted to humans and causes the disease toxoplasmosis. Cats that share litter boxes with one another may increase their exposure to Tritrichomonas foetus, a single-celled flagellated protozoan that resembles Giardia. T. foetus infects the cat’s lower intestine, causing diarrhea, which may also contain mucus or fresh blood in some infected cats.

GENETICS
Cats have never been bred for economic purposes; their matings are extremely difficult to control unless the animals are completely confined. There has been relatively little scientific breeding of cats, and the details of breed inheritance in these animals are not well known.

Cats are genetically far less plastic than dogs and therefore have not offered the same opportunities to breeders. The size differences between breeds in the domestic dog have no parallel in the domestic cat, nor has anything even remotely approaching the wide range of head shapes and body proportions in different breeds of dogs ever appeared among the cats. In cats the physical differences between one breed and another are largely differences in colour and texture of the coat.

COLOUR
The most common coat colours are blotched tabby, black, and orange. The latter term refers to the gene responsible for the expression of creams, yellows, gingers, and reds (“yellow” and “red” can also refer to this group of colours). Solid white is dominant to all other colours. Tortoiseshell, a piebald pattern that results from crossing a black, tabby, or other nonorange colour with a colour from the orange group, is a sex-linked trait. The orange gene is carried on the X chromosome; male tortoiseshells have one extra X chromosome, resulting in an abnormal XXY chromosomal pattern. Hence, male tortoiseshells are born only rarely and are usually sterile. Similarly, tortoiseshell-and-white cats (in North America often called calicoes) are almost always female.

Siamese dilution, the typical coloration of Siamese cats, has been described as a case of imperfect albinism and has been compared to the Himalayan pattern in rabbits, but its heredity is not well understood. There are also dilutions of the other ordinary colours: blue is dilute black and cream is dilute yellow. White spotting also occurs and is dominant to uniform colour.

OTHER CHARACTERS
The long-haired coat of the Persian appears to be a simple unit character. It is recessive to short hair. Eye colour is known to be inherited, but its mode of inheritance is not thoroughly understood. Blue eye colour seems to be associated with dilution in coat colour; blue-eyed white cats are usually deaf, a fact commented on by Charles Darwin. Asymmetry of eye colour is inherited. Polydactylism, the presence of extra toes, is inherited and behaves as a dominant to the normal condition. It seems to be due to a single gene. The extra toes occur on the inner, or thumb, side of the foot.

BREEDS

The number of recognized show breeds that have defined, inherited characteristics has increased dramatically since the late 1950s as cats have become more popular as home companions. The 30 to 40 distinctive breeds can be grouped into two general categories: the long-haired Persian and the domestic shorthair. Both of these breeds occur in various subcategories based on their coat colour, such as white, cream, chinchilla (or silver), smoke, tortoiseshell, and tabby (red, blue, and so on). Other distinctive and popular breeds include the Siamese (with seal point, blue point, chocolate point, and lilac point colour variations), the long-haired Himalayan, which resembles the Siamese in coloration, and the Abyssinian, Burmese, Manx, Rex, and Russian Blue.

The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It also secretes and perceives pheromones.

Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal and reptile species.

As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.

Etymology and naming
The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century. The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African language. The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates. The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ.[citation needed]

The forms might also have derived from an ancient Germanic word that was imported into Latin and then into Greek, Syriac, and Arabic. The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sámi gáđfi, 'female stoat', and Hungarian hölgy, 'lady, female stoat'; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä, 'female (of a furred animal)'.

The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.

A male cat is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered). A female is called a queen or a molly,[user-generated source?] if spayed, especially in a cat-breeding context. A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling.

A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder or a glaring.

Taxonomy
The scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat. Felis catus domesticus was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. Felis daemon proposed by Konstantin Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the Transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat.

In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct species, namely Felis catus. In 2007, it was considered a subspecies, F. silvestris catus, of the European wildcat (F. silvestris) following results of phylogenetic research. In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce followed the recommendation of the ICZN in regarding the domestic cat as a distinct species, Felis catus.

Evolution
Main article: Cat evolution

The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 10 to 15 million years ago. The evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia during the Miocene around 8.38 to 14.45 million years ago. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at 6.46 to 16.76 million years ago. The genus Felis genetically diverged from other Felidae around 6 to 7 million years ago. Results of phylogenetic research shows that the wild members of this genus evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection. The domestic cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genes.

Domestication
See also: Domestication of the cat and Cats in ancient Egypt

A cat eating a fish under a chair, a mural in an Egyptian tomb dating to the 15th century BC
It was long thought that the domestication of the cat began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC, However, the earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 BC. Since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland. Scientists therefore assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, in particular the house mouse (Mus musculus), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers. This mutual relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats. Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time.

The earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in Greece dates to around 1200 BC. Greek, Phoenician, Carthaginian and Etruscan traders introduced domestic cats to southern Europe. During the Roman Empire they were introduced to Corsica and Sardinia before the beginning of the 1st millennium. By the 5th century BC, they were familiar animals around settlements in Magna Graecia and Etruria. By the end of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a Baltic Sea port in northern Germany.

The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BC. This line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today.

During domestication, cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are still capable of surviving in the wild. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have pre-adapted them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play, and high intelligence. Captive Leopardus cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans but were not domesticated. House cats often mate with feral cats. Hybridisation between domestic and other Felinae species is also possible, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat in Scotland.

Development of cat breeds started in the mid 19th century. An analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in the process of domestication, as specific mutations were selected to develop cat breeds. Most breeds are founded on random-bred domestic cats. Genetic diversity of these breeds varies between regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than 20 deleterious genetic disorders.

Characteristics
Main article: Cat anatomy
Size

Diagram of the general anatomy of a male domestic cat
The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat. It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females. Adult domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb).

Skeleton
Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).: 11  The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis.: 16  Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.

Skull

Cat skull

A cat with exposed teeth and claws
The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw.: 35  Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death. Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae.

The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication.: 37  Cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar. Nonetheless, they are subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.

Claws

Shed claw sheaths
Cats have protractible and retractable claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows for the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hindfeet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces.

Most cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear paws. The dewclaw is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth "finger". This special feature of the front paws on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits ("polydactyly"). Polydactylous cats occur along North America's northeast coast and in Great Britain.

Ambulation
The cat is digitigrade. It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible leg. Unlike most mammals, it uses a "pacing" gait and moves both legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain. As it speeds up from walking to trotting, its gait changes to a "diagonal" gait: The diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.

Balance
Duration: 13 minutes and 37 seconds.13:37
Comparison of cat righting reflexes in gravity and zero gravity
Cats are generally fond of sitting in high places or perching. A higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch. Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory. A cat falling from heights of up to 3 m (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws.

During a fall from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet using its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This reflex is known as the cat righting reflex. A cat always rights itself in the same way during a fall, if it has enough time to do so, which is the case in falls of 90 cm (3.0 ft) or more. How cats are able to right themselves when falling has been investigated as the "falling cat problem".

Coats
Main article: Cat coat genetics
The cat family (Felidae) can pass down many colors and patterns to their offspring. The domestic cat genes MC1R and ASIP allow for the variety of color in coats. The feline ASIP gene consists of three coding exons. Three novel microsatellite markers linked to ASIP were isolated from a domestic cat BAC clone containing this gene and were used to perform linkage analysis in a pedigree of 89 domestic cats that segregated for melanism.[citation needed]

Senses
Main article: Cat senses
Vision

Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.: 43  This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration. At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. The domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited. A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone. This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision. Cats also have a nictitating membrane, allowing them to blink without hindering their vision.

Hearing
The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz. It can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only detect frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. It can hear a range of 10.5 octaves, while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9 octaves. Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large movable outer ears, the pinnae, which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise. It can detect ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey. Recent research has shown that cats have socio-spatial cognitive abilities to create mental maps of owners' locations based on hearing owners' voices.

Smell
Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about 5.8 cm2 (0.90 in2) in area, which is about twice that of humans. Cats and many other animals have a Jacobson's organ in their mouths that is used in the behavioral process of flehmening. It allows them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans cannot. Cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol, which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands. Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion. About 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone. This response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine (Actinidia polygama) and the herb valerian; it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors.

Taste
Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 on the human tongue). Domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness. They, however, possess taste bud receptors specialized for acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastes. Their taste buds possess the receptors needed to detect umami. However, these receptors contain molecular changes that make the cat taste of umami different from that of humans. In humans, they detect the amino acids of glutamic acid and aspartic acid, but in cats they instead detect nucleotides, in this case inosine monophosphate and l-Histidine. These nucleotides are particularly enriched in tuna. This has been argued is why cats find tuna so palatable: as put by researchers into cat taste, "the specific combination of the high IMP and free l-Histidine contents of tuna" .. "produces a strong umami taste synergy that is highly preferred by cats". One of the researchers involved in this research has further claimed, "I think umami is as important for cats as sweet is for humans".

Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around 38 °C (100 °F) which is similar to that of a fresh kill; some cats reject cold food (which would signal to the cat that the "prey" item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing).

Whiskers

The whiskers of a cat are highly sensitive to touch.
To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces. These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage.: 47 

Behavior
See also: Cat behavior
Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night. Domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes but can range many hundreds of meters from this central point. They establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging 7–28 ha (17–69 acres). The timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied but being low-light predators, they are generally crepuscular, which means they tend to be more active near dawn and dusk. However, house cats' behavior is also influenced by human activity and they may adapt to their owners' sleeping patterns to some extent.

Cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older. The daily duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the average. Some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours. The term "cat nap" for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period. While asleep, cats experience short periods of rapid eye movement sleep often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming.

Sociability

The social behavior of the domestic cat ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that gather around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females. Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others. Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories. These territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation. Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling and, if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks. Despite this colonial organization, cats do not have a social survival strategy or a herd behavior, and always hunt alone.

Life in proximity to humans and other domestic animals has led to a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. Ethologically, a cat's human keeper functions as if a mother surrogate. Adult cats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. Their high-pitched sounds may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly difficult for humans to ignore. Some pet cats are poorly socialized. In particular, older cats show aggressiveness toward newly arrived kittens, which include biting and scratching; this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggression.

Redirected aggression is a common form of aggression which can occur in multiple cat households. In redirected aggression there is usually something that agitates the cat: this could be a sight, sound, or another source of stimuli which causes a heightened level of anxiety or arousal. If the cat cannot attack the stimuli, it may direct anger elsewhere by attacking or directing aggression to the nearest cat, dog, human or other being.

Domestic cats' scent rubbing behavior toward humans or other cats is thought to be a feline means for social bonding.

Communication
Main article: Cat communication

Vocalizing domestic cat
Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing. Their body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats. A raised tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicate hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate ones. Feral cats are generally silent.: 208  Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head.

Purring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signaling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens, who are thought to use it as a care-soliciting signal. Post-nursing cats also often purr as a sign of contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eating. Even though purring is popularly interpreted as indicative of pleasure, it has been recorded in a wide variety of circumstances, most of which involve physical contact between the cat and another, presumably trusted individual. Some cats have been observed to purr continuously when chronically ill or in apparent pain.

The exact mechanism by which cats purr has long been elusive, but it has been proposed that purring is generated via a series of sudden build-ups and releases of pressure as the glottis is opened and closed, which causes the vocal folds to separate forcefully. The laryngeal muscles in control of the glottis are thought to be driven by a neural oscillator which generates a cycle of contraction and release every 30–40 milliseconds (giving a frequency of 33 to 25 Hz).

Domestic cats observed in a rescue facility have total of 276 distinct facial expressions based on 26 different facial movements; each facial expression corresponds to different social functions that are likely influenced by domestication.

Grooming

The hooked papillae on a cat's tongue act like a hairbrush to help clean and detangle fur
Cats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean. The cat's tongue has backward-facing spines about 500 μm long, which are called papillae. These contain keratin which makes them rigid so the papillae act like a hairbrush. Some cats, particularly longhaired cats, occasionally regurgitate hairballs of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming. These clumps of fur are usually sausage-shaped and about 2–3 cm (0.79–1.18 in) long. Hairballs can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the gut, as well as regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush.

Fighting

A domestic cat's arched back, raised fur, and open-mouthed hiss are signs of aggression.
Among domestic cats, males are more likely to fight than females. Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female. In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.

When cats become aggressive, they try to make themselves appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting. Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. Cats may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponents. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.

Serious damage is rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears. Fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus. Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose. Cats are willing to threaten animals larger than them to defend their territory, such as dogs and foxes.

Hunting and feeding
See also: Cat food

The shape and structure of cats' cheeks is insufficient to allow them to take in liquids using suction. Therefore, when drinking they lap with the tongue to draw liquid upward into their mouths. Lapping at a rate of four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the surface of the water, and quickly retracts it like a corkscrew, drawing water upward.

Feral cats and free-fed house cats consume several small meals in a day. The frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. They select food based on its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most strongly to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. It is also a common misconception that cats like milk/cream, as they tend to avoid sweet food and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugar in milk is not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea. Some also develop odd eating habits and like to eat or chew on things like wool, plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.

Cats hunt small prey, primarily birds and rodents, and are often used as a form of pest control. Other common small creatures such as lizards and snakes may also become prey. Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured. The strategy used depends on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.: 153  Domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.3 to 4.0 billion birds and 6.3 to 22.3 billion mammals annually.

Certain species appear more susceptible than others; in one English village, for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality was linked to the domestic cat. In the recovery of ringed robins (Erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (Prunella modularis) in Britain, 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation. In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety.

Perhaps the best-known element of cats' hunting behavior, which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture, is that cats often appear to "play" with prey by releasing and recapturing it. This cat and mouse behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.

Another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians. One explanation is that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the dominance hierarchy, in which humans are reacted to as if they are at or near the top. Another explanation is that they attempt to teach their guardians to hunt or to help their human as if feeding "an elderly cat, or an inept kitten". This hypothesis is inconsistent with the fact that male cats also bring home prey, despite males having negligible involvement in raising kittens.: 153 

Play
Main article: Cat play and toys
Play fight between kittens aged 14 weeks
Domestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of play. This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey. Cats also engage in play fighting, with each other and with humans. This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals.

Cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry. Owing to the close similarity between play and hunting, cats prefer to play with objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest. They become habituated to a toy they have played with before. String is often used as a toy, but if it is eaten, it can become caught at the base of the cat's tongue and then move into the intestines, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death. Owing to the risks posed by cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer's dot, which cats may chase.

Reproduction
See also: Kitten

When cats mate, the tomcat (male) bites the scruff of the female's neck as she assumes a position conducive to mating known as lordosis behavior.
The cat secretes and perceives pheromones. Female cats, called queens, are polyestrous with several estrus cycles during a year, lasting usually 21 days. They are usually ready to mate between early February and August in northern temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions.

Several males, called tomcats, are attracted to a female in heat. They fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually, the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backward-pointing penile spines, which are about 1 mm (0.039 in) long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines may provide the female with increased sexual stimulation, which acts to induce ovulation.

After mating, the female cleans her vulva thoroughly. If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female attacks him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat. Because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.

The morula forms 124 hours after conception. At 148 hours, early blastocysts form. At 10–12 days, implantation occurs. The gestation of queens lasts between 64 and 67 days, with an average of 65 days.


A newborn kitten
Data on the reproductive capacity of more than 2,300 free-ranging queens were collected during a study between May 1998 and October 2000. They had one to six kittens per litter, with an average of three kittens. They produced a mean of 1.4 litters per year, but a maximum of three litters in a year. Of 169 kittens, 127 died before they were six months old due to a trauma caused in most cases by dog attacks and road accidents. The first litter is usually smaller than subsequent litters. Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks of age. Queens normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months, and males at 5–7 months. This varies depending on breed. Kittens reach puberty at the age of 9–10 months.

Cats are ready to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they are ready to leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as seven weeks to limit unwanted reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed before puberty, at about three to six months. In the United States, about 80% of household cats are neutered.

Lifespan and health
Main articles: Cat health and Aging in cats
The average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades. In the early 1980s, it was about seven years,: 33  rising to 9.4 years in 1995: 33  and an average of about 13 years as of 2014 and 2023. Some cats have been reported as surviving into their 30s, with the oldest known cat dying at a verified age of 38.

Neutering increases life expectancy: one study found castrated male cats live twice as long as intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females.: 35  Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.

Disease
Main article: List of feline diseases
About 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats, many similar to human inborn errors of metabolism. The high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the human diseases. Diseases affecting domestic cats include acute infections, parasitic infestations, injuries, and chronic diseases such as kidney disease, thyroid disease, and arthritis. Vaccinations are available for many infectious diseases, as are treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms, ticks, and fleas.

Ecology
Habitats
The domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of the world. It is adaptable and now present on all continents except Antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands, even on the isolated Kerguelen Islands. Due to its ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat, it is among the world's most invasive species. It lives on small islands with no human inhabitants. Feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands.

The unwantedness that leads to the domestic cat being treated as an invasive species is twofold. On one hand, as it is little altered from the wildcat, it can readily interbreed with the wildcat. This hybridization poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in Scotland and Hungary, possibly also the Iberian Peninsula, and where protected natural areas are close to human-dominated landscapes, such as Kruger National Park in South Africa. However, its introduction to places where no native felines are present also contributes to the decline of native species.

Ferality
Main article: Feral cat

Feral farm cat
Feral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas. The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the United States feral population range from 25 to 60 million. Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food. Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.

Public attitudes toward feral cats vary widely, from seeing them as free-ranging pets to regarding them as vermin.

Some feral cats can be successfully socialized and 're-tamed' for adoption; young cats, especially kittens and cats that have had prior experience and contact with humans are the most receptive to these efforts.

Impact on wildlife
Main article: Cat predation on wildlife
On islands, birds can contribute as much as 60% of a cat's diet. In nearly all cases, the cat cannot be identified as the sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds, and in some instances, eradication of cats has caused a "mesopredator release" effect; where the suppression of top carnivores creates an abundance of smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared prey. Domestic cats are a contributing factor to the decline of many species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, to extinction. The South Island piopio, Chatham rail, and the New Zealand merganser are a few from a long list, with the most extreme case being the flightless Lyall's wren, which was driven to extinction only a few years after its discovery. One feral cat in New Zealand killed 102 New Zealand lesser short-tailed bats in seven days. In the US, feral and free-ranging domestic cats kill an estimated 6.3 – 22.3 billion mammals annually.

In Australia, the impact of cats on mammal populations is even greater than the impact of habitat loss. More than one million reptiles are killed by feral cats each day, representing 258 species. Cats have contributed to the extinction of the Navassa curly-tailed lizard and Chioninia coctei.

Interaction with humans

Cats are common pets throughout the world, and their worldwide population as of 2007 exceeded 500 million. As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.

Cats have been used for millennia to control rodents, notably around grain stores and aboard ships, and both uses extend to the present day.

As well as being kept as pets, cats are also used in the international fur trade and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets, stuffed toys, shoes, gloves, and musical instruments. About 24 cats are needed to make a cat-fur coat. This use has been outlawed in the United States since 2000 and in the European Union (as well as the United Kingdom) since 2007.

Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practice of witchcraft, and are still made into blankets in Switzerland as traditional medicine thought to cure rheumatism.

A few attempts to build a cat census have been made over the years, both through associations or national and international organizations (such as that of the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies) and over the Internet, but such a task does not seem simple to achieve. General estimates for the global population of domestic cats range widely from anywhere between 200 million to 600 million. Walter Chandoha made his career photographing cats after his 1949 images of Loco, an especially charming stray taken in, were published around the world. He is reported to have photographed 90,000 cats during his career and maintained an archive of 225,000 images that he drew from for publications during his lifetime.

Shows
Main article: Cat show
A cat show is a judged event in which the owners of cats compete to win titles in various cat-registering organizations by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard. It is often required that a cat must be healthy and vaccinated in order to participate in a cat show. Both pedigreed and non-purebred companion ("moggy") cats are admissible, although the rules differ depending on the organization. Competing cats are compared to the applicable breed standard, and assessed for temperament.

Infection
Main article: Feline zoonosis
Cats can be infected or infested with viruses, bacteria, fungus, protozoans, arthropods or worms that can transmit diseases to humans. In some cases, the cat exhibits no symptoms of the disease. The same disease can then become evident in a human. The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and immune status of the person. Humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected. Others might also acquire infections from cat feces and parasites exiting the cat's body. Some of the infections of most concern include salmonella, cat-scratch disease and toxoplasmosis.

History and mythology
Main articles: Cultural depictions of cats and Cats in ancient Egypt
In ancient Egypt, cats were worshipped, and the goddess Bastet often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the war-like aspect of a lioness. The Greek historian Herodotus reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrows. Families took their dead cats to the sacred city of Bubastis, where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories. Herodotus expressed astonishment at the domestic cats in Egypt, because he had only ever seen wildcats.

Ancient Greeks and Romans kept weasels as pets, which were seen as the ideal rodent-killers. The earliest unmistakable evidence of the Greeks having domestic cats comes from two coins from Magna Graecia dating to the mid-fifth century BC showing Iokastos and Phalanthos, the legendary founders of Rhegion and Taras respectively, playing with their pet cats. The usual ancient Greek word for 'cat' was ailouros, meaning 'thing with the waving tail'. Cats are rarely mentioned in ancient Greek literature. Aristotle remarked in his History of Animals that "female cats are naturally lecherous." The Greeks later syncretized their own goddess Artemis with the Egyptian goddess Bastet, adopting Bastet's associations with cats and ascribing them to Artemis. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, when the deities flee to Egypt and take animal forms, the goddess Diana turns into a cat.

Cats eventually displaced weasels as the pest control of choice because they were more pleasant to have around the house and were more enthusiastic hunters of mice. During the Middle Ages, many of Artemis's associations with cats were grafted onto the Virgin Mary. Cats are often shown in icons of Annunciation and of the Holy Family and, according to Italian folklore, on the same night that Mary gave birth to Jesus, a cat in Bethlehem gave birth to a kitten. Domestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the Age of Discovery, as ships' cats were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as good-luck charms.

Several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans. In Japan, the maneki neko cat is a symbol of good fortune. In Norse mythology, Freyja, the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats. In Jewish legend, the first cat was living in the house of the first man Adam as a pet that got rid of mice. The cat was once partnering with the first dog before the latter broke an oath they had made which resulted in enmity between the descendants of these two animals. It is also written that neither cats nor foxes are represented in the water, while every other animal has an incarnation species in the water. Although no species are sacred in Islam, cats are revered by Muslims. Some Western writers have stated Muhammad had a favorite cat, Muezza. He is reported to have loved cats so much, "he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it". The story has no origin in early Muslim writers, and seems to confuse a story of a later Sufi saint, Ahmed ar-Rifa'i, centuries after Muhammad. One of the companions of Muhammad was known as Abu Hurayrah ("father of the kitten"), in reference to his documented affection to cats.

Superstitions and rituals
Many cultures have negative superstitions about cats. An example would be the belief that encountering a black cat ("crossing one's path") leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' familiars used to augment a witch's powers and skills. The killing of cats in Medieval Ypres, Belgium, is commemorated in the innocuous present-day Kattenstoet (cat parade). In mid-16th century France, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment, particularly during midsummer festivals. According to Norman Davies, the assembled people "shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized". The remaining ashes were sometimes taken back home by the people for good luck.

According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six. An early mention of the myth can be found in John Heywood's The Proverbs of John Heywood (1546):

Husband, (quoth she), ye studie, be merrie now,
And even as ye thinke now, so come to yow.
Nay not so, (quoth he), for my thought to tell right,
I thinke how you lay groning, wife, all last night.
Husband, a groning horse and a groning wife
Never faile their master, (quoth she), for my life.
No wife, a woman hath nine lives like a cat.

The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.

Cats are carnivores and primarily eat meat.
A healthy cat diet includes protein from meat or fish.
Domestic cats typically eat commercial cat food.
Cats should not eat chocolate or onions.
The average cat sleeps 12-16 hours per day.

Cats have been domesticated for thousands of years, with their history as pets dating back to ancient Egypt around 4,000 years ago. Egyptians revered cats, associating them with the goddess Bastet and often depicting them in art. They were prized for their ability to hunt rodents, protecting food stores and reducing disease. As trade expanded, cats spread across civilizations, becoming valued companions in Greece, Rome, and beyond. In medieval Europe, they faced superstition and persecution but later regained favor for their pest-control skills. By the 19th and 20th centuries, selective breeding led to the diverse cat breeds we know today, and they became one of the world’s most popular pets.
Cats come in a wide variety of breeds, each with unique characteristics in appearance, temperament, and care needs. Here are some notable breeds:

- **Persian** – Known for their long, luxurious fur and flat faces, Persians are calm, affectionate, and enjoy a relaxed lifestyle. They require regular grooming due to their thick coats.  
- **Maine Coon** – One of the largest domestic cat breeds, Maine Coons have tufted ears, bushy tails, and friendly, social personalities. They are intelligent and enjoy interactive play.  
- **Siamese** – Sleek, short-haired cats with striking blue eyes and a vocal, affectionate nature. Siamese cats love attention and bond closely with their owners.  
- **Bengal** – Athletic and energetic, Bengals have a wild appearance with leopard-like spots. They enjoy climbing, playing in water, and need mental stimulation.  
- **Ragdoll** – These large, floppy cats are known for their docile, affectionate personalities. They often go limp when picked up and enjoy being held.  
- **Scottish Fold** – Recognizable by their folded ears, these cats are sweet-natured and love companionship. They are playful but not overly energetic.  
- **Sphynx** – Hairless and known for their wrinkled skin, Sphynx cats are social, affectionate, and love warmth. They require regular skin care due to oil buildup.  
- **British Shorthair** – Sturdy, round-faced cats with plush coats, British Shorthairs are independent yet affectionate, making them great companions.  
- **Abyssinian** – Active and curious, Abyssinians have a sleek, short coat and love to climb and explore. They are intelligent and enjoy interactive play.  
- **Russian Blue** – With a dense blue-gray coat and striking green eyes, Russian Blues are gentle, reserved, and form strong bonds with their owners.  

Each breed has its own unique personality and care requirements, making it important to choose one that fits your lifestyle.
### **Whiskers and the Midnight City**  

Whiskers was no ordinary cat—he was the king of the rooftops. From his perch atop an old bookstore, he watched the city below, the neon lights reflecting in his emerald-green eyes. He knew every alley, every shortcut, and every kind-hearted shopkeeper who left out scraps for him.  

By day, he napped in sunbeams that slipped through the cracks of fire escapes. But at night, the city belonged to him. He dashed across rooftops, leaped from ledges, and slipped through shadows like a ghost. The bakery on 5th Street was his first stop—a warm croissant corner left just for him. Then, he’d visit the jazz bar, where the saxophonist always gave him a knowing nod.  

One night, Whiskers heard a faint meow echoing from a dark alley. A tiny kitten, no older than a few weeks, shivered beneath a pile of cardboard. Whiskers, a loner by nature, hesitated—but only for a moment. He nudged the kitten with his nose, purring softly.  

For the first time, Whiskers wasn’t just the king of the rooftops. He was a guardian, a guide. And as the city hummed and flickered around them, he led the kitten toward warmth, food, and a new adventure.
**The Complete Guide to Cats: History, Biology, Behavior, and Cultural Significance**

### **Introduction**
Cats (Felis catus) have been companions to humans for thousands of years, evolving from wild hunters to beloved household pets. Their mysterious nature, agility, and intelligence have fascinated humans across cultures and time periods. This comprehensive guide explores the history, biology, behavior, and cultural impact of cats, providing an in-depth look at these enigmatic creatures.

### **History of Cats as Domesticated Animals**

#### **Origins and Early Domestication**
The domestic cat is believed to have descended from the African wildcat (*Felis lybica*). Archaeological evidence suggests that cats first associated with humans around 9,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, where early civilizations stored grain. These grain stores attracted rodents, and wildcats followed, hunting the pests. Humans recognized the benefits of having these natural hunters around and likely encouraged their presence, leading to a mutualistic relationship.

One of the earliest known examples of cat domestication is a 9,500-year-old burial site in Cyprus, where a human was buried alongside a cat, suggesting a special bond. Over time, selective breeding and human interaction led to the domesticated cat as we know it today.

#### **Cats in Ancient Civilizations**
In ancient Egypt, cats were revered and even worshipped. The goddess Bastet, depicted with the head of a lioness or domestic cat, symbolized home, fertility, and protection. Killing a cat, even accidentally, was punishable by death in some periods of Egyptian history. Many families kept cats as pets, and they were often mummified alongside their owners.

Cats also played roles in other ancient cultures. In China, they were valued for pest control in rice storage areas. In ancient Rome, they were seen as symbols of independence and were kept as both pets and working animals.

#### **Cats in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance**
During the Middle Ages in Europe, cats became associated with superstitions and witchcraft. Many believed they were familiars of witches, leading to mass killings of cats. This, ironically, may have contributed to the spread of the Black Death, as the reduced cat population allowed rat populations to thrive.

By the Renaissance, cats regained favor in Europe, particularly among royalty and scholars. Cardinal Richelieu, a chief minister of France, famously kept many cats in his home. During the Age of Exploration, sailors brought cats aboard ships to control rodents, spreading them to new lands.

### **Biology and Physical Characteristics of Cats**

#### **Anatomy and Physiology**
Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require meat to survive. Their sharp teeth and retractable claws make them highly efficient predators. Their bodies are built for stealth and agility, with powerful hind legs that allow them to jump up to six times their body length.

A cat’s whiskers, or vibrissae, are highly sensitive and help them navigate in the dark by detecting changes in air currents. Their keen night vision, due to a high concentration of rod cells in their retinas, makes them exceptional nocturnal hunters.

#### **Senses**
- **Vision**: Cats see well in low light but have limited color perception compared to humans.
- **Hearing**: They can detect ultrasonic frequencies, allowing them to hear rodent movements.
- **Smell**: Cats have an acute sense of smell, which helps them identify food, territory, and potential mates.
- **Touch**: Their paw pads contain sensitive nerve endings, aiding in balance and environmental awareness.

#### **Lifespan and Health**
The average lifespan of a domestic cat ranges from 12 to 18 years, though some have been known to live into their 30s. Regular veterinary care, a balanced diet, and a safe environment contribute to a cat’s longevity.

Common health issues include:
- Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)
- Feline leukemia virus (FeLV)
- Dental disease
- Kidney disease
- Obesity-related conditions

### **Behavior and Communication**

#### **Social Structure**
Cats are often thought to be solitary animals, but they exhibit a range of social behaviors. In feral cat colonies, related females form close-knit groups, raising kittens communally. Domestic cats display attachment to humans and other animals, often forming bonds with their owners.

#### **Vocalizations and Body Language**
Cats communicate through a variety of sounds, including:
- **Meowing**: Primarily used to communicate with humans rather than other cats.
- **Purring**: Often associated with contentment but can also signal pain or distress.
- **Hissing and Growling**: Defensive signals to warn threats.
- **Chirping and Chattering**: Often heard when a cat watches birds or prey animals.

Their body language also conveys emotions:
- **Ears forward**: Curiosity or friendliness.
- **Tail upright**: A sign of greeting and happiness.
- **Arched back and puffed tail**: Defensive posture.
- **Slow blinking**: A sign of trust and affection.

### **Cats in Culture and Mythology**

#### **Folklore and Superstitions**
Throughout history, cats have been linked to myths and superstitions. In Japan, the *Maneki-neko*, or beckoning cat, is believed to bring good luck. In Norse mythology, Freyja, the goddess of love and war, had a chariot pulled by large cats.

#### **Cats in Literature and Art**
Cats have appeared in countless works of literature, from Edgar Allan Poe’s *The Black Cat* to T.S. Eliot’s *Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats*, which inspired the musical *Cats*. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci sketched cats, fascinated by their fluid movement.

#### **Cats in Popular Culture**
Modern media features numerous famous cats, such as:
- Garfield (cartoon)
- Felix the Cat (animated character)
- Cheshire Cat (Alice in Wonderland)
- Puss in Boots (fairy tale and animated films)

Cats dominate the internet era, with viral videos and memes contributing to their enduring appeal.

### **Conclusion**
From ancient temple guardians to viral internet stars, cats have held a unique place in human history and culture. Their intelligence, independence, and affectionate nature make them one of the most beloved animals in the world. Whether serving as skilled hunters, loyal companions, or artistic inspirations, cats continue to captivate and enrich the lives of those who welcome them into their homes.

Once, in a world not unlike our own but layered with magic and hidden truths, cats ruled the twilight hours between reality and dream. To the untrained eye, they were simply companions, curling by the hearth or stalking through alleyways, but to those who knew better, they were the silent custodians of secrets, slipping between realms like whispers on the wind.

Among them was Nyx, a sleek black cat with eyes that gleamed like twin moons. She was no ordinary feline—her lineage traced back to the great Bastet of Egypt, the goddess who walked among men in feline form, revered as a protector and bringer of good fortune. But Nyx was neither a temple guardian nor a simple pet; she was an Archivist of the Forgotten, charged with preserving the lost knowledge of the world.

She moved unseen through the city of Obscura, where shadows whispered in ancient tongues, and alleyways twisted in ways that defied geometry. The city was a place where creatures of myth found refuge—the last kitsune of Japan, the remnants of Puss-in-Boots’ legacy, and the spectral descendants of the Cheshire Cat, who could vanish into the seams of time itself.

One night, as Nyx prowled the rooftops, she sensed a disturbance in the Veil—the invisible fabric separating the mundane from the arcane. Her fur bristled. Somewhere, something old had awoken. It was not the first time she had felt such tremors. She had seen what happened when the Veil was breached: the Rakshasa of the East slipping into the waking world, the Black Shuck of England bringing omens of death, and the ghostly paw prints of Schrödinger’s Cat, eternally appearing and vanishing with paradoxical uncertainty.

She leapt down onto the cobbled streets, her paws making no sound. The air smelled of forgotten books and lightning—signs of an imminent shift in reality. As she rounded a corner, she found an unlikely ally waiting: Grimalkin, an aged and wise tomcat with fur like storm clouds. Legends spoke of Grimalkin as a familiar to the witches of old, his knowledge spanning centuries of magic, from the alchemy of medieval Europe to the celestial writings of Babylon.

"You've felt it too," Grimalkin rumbled, his voice like distant thunder. "The Library of Lost Names is awakening."

Nyx's tail flicked. "Then we have no time to waste. The others must be warned."

Together, they raced toward the Nexus, a hidden sanctuary where the greatest feline minds convened. There, among the statues of the Lion of Nemea and the sacred markings of the Nine Lives Council, cats of legend gathered: the saber-toothed ancestors of Smilodon, the spectral echoes of the first domesticated cats in Mesopotamia, and even the elusive Barong Ket, the Balinese guardian of balance.

The Council had convened only once before—in the days when the Sphinx whispered riddles that held the fate of empires. Now, as the threads of history unraveled once more, the feline scholars prepared for a battle not fought with claws, but with knowledge. For in the endless war between chaos and order, it was the cats who held the oldest wisdom, their whiskers attuned to the shifting tides of fate.

And as Nyx stepped forward to speak, the world held its breath, waiting for the words that would shape the course of destiny itself.

**1. The Cat Who Saved a Family**

When I was a child, we had a tabby cat named Oliver who was more than just a pet—he was our family’s guardian. One night, a fire broke out in our kitchen due to a faulty wire. Everyone was asleep, unaware of the danger. Oliver, sensing something was wrong, meowed loudly and ran across the house, scratching at the doors of every bedroom. My parents woke up first, alarmed by his unusual behavior, and discovered the smoke filling the hallway. Thanks to Oliver, we were able to escape safely. From that night on, he was more than just a beloved pet—he was our hero.

**2. Midnight’s Secret Life**

Midnight was a sleek black cat who belonged to my grandmother. He was affectionate but fiercely independent. Every morning, he would leave the house, disappearing into the neighborhood for hours before returning for his meals. We always wondered where he went, until one winter night, when a heavy snowstorm stranded him outside. We searched for him in the morning and found him curled up in a tiny shed behind a neighbor’s house. To our surprise, inside the shed were four kittens—Midnight’s own secret family. My grandmother took them all in, and Midnight continued his double life, dividing his love between two homes.

**3. The Mysterious Visitor**

One summer, a cat started visiting my backyard every day. He was a beautiful Siamese with piercing blue eyes, but he wouldn’t let anyone come close. We left food and water for him, and slowly, he began to trust us. After a few months, he finally let me pet him, and we decided to name him Shadow. He spent two years with us before one day disappearing just as mysteriously as he had arrived. A year later, I spotted him sitting on a windowsill of a house a few blocks away. It turns out he had been someone else’s pet all along, but he had chosen to spend his time with us for a little while.

**4. Whiskers and the Newborn**

When my sister had her first baby, her cat, Whiskers, immediately took on the role of protector. He would sit beside the crib, watching over the baby as she slept. If she cried, Whiskers would run to fetch my sister, meowing insistently until she came. One evening, when the baby had a slight fever, Whiskers refused to leave her side. He kept nudging my sister, acting restless and distressed. Concerned, my sister took the baby to the doctor, where they found out she had a developing infection that needed treatment. We always said that Whiskers had a sixth sense when it came to keeping our family safe.

**5. The Train Station Cat**

In the small town where I grew up, there was a cat named Charlie who lived at the local train station. No one knew where he came from, but he had been there for years. He would greet passengers, walking confidently among the commuters like he was part of the staff. The station workers made a little bed for him in the ticket booth, and travelers would bring him treats. He became such a beloved part of the community that when the station underwent renovations, they made sure to keep a special space for him. To this day, Charlie is still there, welcoming passengers on their journeys.

**6. Luna, the Cat Who Could Open Doors**

Luna was a clever Maine Coon who belonged to my best friend. She had an unusual talent—she could open doors. At first, we thought it was a coincidence, but then we saw her jumping up, using her paws to twist the door handle and push it open. It became a game for her; she would open doors just to explore rooms she wasn’t supposed to enter. Once, she even let the dog out of the house by accident. She was mischievous, but her intelligence made her unforgettable.

**7. The Stray That Chose Me**

I never planned on having a cat, but one rainy evening, a small, soaked kitten showed up at my doorstep. I brought her inside, gave her food, and wrapped her in a towel. I thought she would stay just for the night, but she never left. I named her Misty, and from that moment on, she followed me everywhere. She was my constant companion, sitting next to me while I worked, curling up at my feet every night. She had chosen me, and I couldn’t imagine my life without her.

**8. The Adventure Cat**

My cousin had a cat named Felix who loved adventure. Unlike most cats who preferred staying indoors, Felix wanted to be outside all the time. He would go on long walks with my cousin, trotting alongside like a small dog. He even learned to wear a harness and go hiking with her. One time, they went camping in the mountains, and Felix climbed a tree so high they thought they would have to call for help. But just as they were about to panic, Felix skillfully climbed down on his own, looking proud of his accomplishment.

**9. The Cat Who Knew the Bus Schedule**

In my neighborhood, there was a cat named Benny who belonged to an elderly woman. Benny had a habit of walking her to the bus stop every morning and then waiting for her return in the afternoon. He seemed to know exactly when her bus would arrive, sitting patiently until she stepped off. After she passed away, Benny continued going to the bus stop every day, as if waiting for her. Eventually, a kind neighbor adopted him, and while he adjusted to his new home, he never forgot the bus stop where he had waited so faithfully.

**10. The Cat Who Loved Music**

I once had a cat named Mozart who had an unusual love for music. Every time I played the piano, he would jump onto the bench beside me and purr loudly. If I stopped playing, he would paw at the keys, trying to make sounds himself. His favorite instrument was the violin—whenever I practiced, he would sit beside me, listening intently. Music seemed to calm him, and he would even fall asleep to certain pieces. It was as if he had been a musician in another life.

Each of these cats left a lasting impression, proving that our feline friends are more than just pets—they are companions, protectors, and sometimes even heroes.

Ah, sonny, you wanna hear about cats? Pull up a chair, get comfortable, because I got stories about cats that’ll take you through the ages. You know, I’ve lived a long life, seen the world change in ways I never imagined, but one thing that’s stayed constant—one thing that’s been a companion through thick and thin—is the cat.  

Now, I ain’t talking about just any old cat. No, sir. I’m talking about the kind of cat that leaves a mark on your soul, that comes into your life like a whisper in the wind and stays like an old memory you never want to forget. I’ve had cats since before I even knew what it meant to have a friend. 

There was old Whiskers, back when I was just a boy. He wasn’t no pampered housecat—Whiskers was a barn cat, mean as the devil to anyone who wasn’t me. He had this orange coat, but it was so full of dust and hay that most of the time he looked like a little tornado of fur and attitude. That cat, he’d sit on the highest beam in the barn, watching everything, waiting for a mouse to scurry out, and then BAM! He’d pounce like a tiger. I swear, that cat had the soul of a hunter. But you know what? Every night, he’d climb up onto my bed and curl up on my chest, purring like a little motor, like all the fight had drained right out of him the moment he found me. That was Whiskers. Tough as nails, soft as silk.  

Then there was Bella, the queen of my first apartment. She wasn’t just a cat—no, she was a lady of refinement, a creature of dignity. She had this way of sitting, all proper-like, tail wrapped neatly around her paws, watching me with those green eyes like she was judging every life decision I ever made. I remember I once brought home a girl I fancied, and Bella took one look at her, then turned her back and started licking her paw. That was all I needed to know—Bella didn’t approve. And you know what? Turns out Bella was right. That girl left in the middle of the night and took my damn watch with her. Should’ve listened to the cat.  

And oh, let me tell you about Max. Max wasn’t just a cat, he was a legend. Big, black, and bold, like a panther who shrank in the wash. He had a scar across his nose from some long-forgotten battle, and I swear he walked like he had his own theme music. He ruled the neighborhood, every other cat either feared him or followed him. I’d sit on the porch and watch him strut down the sidewalk like he owned the place, and in a way, he did. But for all his bravado, he was a big softie when it came to me. Every night, without fail, he’d jump up onto the couch, headbutt me right in the chest, and flop down beside me like he was done ruling the world for the day.  

And son, I could go on. There was Sooty, who survived a snowstorm by climbing into the engine of my truck and scared the hell out of me when I started it up. There was Little Miss, who figured out how to open the cabinet where I kept the cat treats and nearly gave herself a feast-induced coma. And good ol’ Jasper, who’d disappear for three days at a time and always come back smelling like someone else’s perfume—never did figure out where he was getting to, but he always had a smug look when he came home.  

Cats, boy, they got a way of making life richer, of slipping into the cracks of your heart and staying there forever. They’re not like dogs, no, they don’t give love away for free. You gotta earn it. But once you do? Oh, it’s a love like no other. It’s quiet, it’s steady, and it’s always there, like the hum of an old song you can’t quite remember but never forget.  

Ah, but listen to me rambling on. You got time for another story? ‘Cause I got plenty more where that came from…

Oh, darling, you want to talk about cats? Oh, sit down, let me get you some tea, because I could go on forever! I tell you, my entire life has been touched by cats in ways that no mere mortal could understand. They are not just pets, dear, they are companions, confidants, tiny emperors who rule our homes with velvet paws and piercing stares.  

Let me start with Mabel, my first cat. I was just a girl, you see, and Mabel was this little ball of grey fluff with the biggest yellow eyes you ever did see. She wasn’t a kitten I picked out—no, no, she picked me. I was sitting on the steps of my grandmother’s porch when she trotted right up, sniffed my hand, and then sat down like she had made a decision. And that was that. She followed me home, climbed onto my bed, and never left. That cat, I swear, knew my moods better than I did. If I was upset, she would sit on my lap, gently kneading my arm, like she was massaging the sadness away. And if I was happy? Oh, she’d be right there, tail flicking, purring like an engine. She was my shadow, my sister, my little grey ghost.  

And then there was Theodore—Theo, my big, fluffy, orange gentleman. He had the most luxurious coat, long and thick, and honestly, he knew he was beautiful. He would strut around the house like he was some kind of royal dignitary, sitting on the highest perch of his cat tree like it was a throne. And the attitude? Oh, Theo would not tolerate nonsense. I once had a boyfriend—oh, I won’t name names, but let’s just say Theo had a better sense of character than I did. The moment that man stepped into my apartment, Theo puffed up like a grand duke about to go to war. He sat on the arm of the couch, staring, unmoving, unblinking, judging. And when my boyfriend tried to pet him? Oh, no, Theo slapped his hand away like an insulted aristocrat. Turns out, Theo was right—the man was no good. You should always trust a cat’s instincts, dear, they know things.  

And let me tell you about my little mischief-maker, Juniper. Juniper was a tiny, sleek black cat with the biggest personality crammed into the smallest body. She was the queen of trouble. I’d wake up in the morning to find my jewelry scattered across the floor because Juniper had spent the night batting everything off my vanity. I once caught her dragging an entire baguette off the kitchen counter. How she thought she was going to eat it, I’ll never know, but she had the determination of a cat three times her size. And oh, the games she played! If I ever so much as moved a ribbon, she was on it in seconds, leaping, twisting, attacking with the precision of a ninja. That cat had energy for days, but when she finally tired herself out, she would curl up in the crook of my neck, purring so softly that it felt like a lullaby just for me.  

Of course, I can’t forget Eloise. Oh, Eloise was drama personified. A calico with a flair for the theatrical. If she wanted attention, she would throw herself onto the floor like a swooning actress in an old black-and-white film. And the way she would meow—oh, darling, she didn’t just meow, she *spoke*. She had a full conversation with you whether you wanted to or not. If I dared leave the house without giving her a proper goodbye, she would *yell* at me the moment I returned, berating me for my betrayal. And if dinner was even a minute late? Oh, the scandal! She would flick her tail, turn her back on me, and dramatically sigh as if she had been *starving* for weeks. The sass on that cat!  

And oh, don’t even get me started on Mr. Buttons. That cat... well, he was *too* smart for his own good. He figured out how to open doors. I kid you not, I would come home and find cabinets open, food missing, and Mr. Buttons sitting there with the *smuggest* look on his face. One time, I woke up to find my closet door wide open, my sweaters pulled off the shelves, and Mr. Buttons sleeping in a perfect little nest he had built for himself. And if I tried to move him? Oh no, I was the villain in that story. He would stretch, blink at me like I had disturbed the most important nap of his life, and roll over. The nerve!  

I tell you, darling, cats are not just pets. They are *characters*, each with their own story, their own quirks, their own way of winding themselves around your heart and never letting go. They are mischievous, wise, elegant, and ridiculous all at the same time. They teach us patience, they teach us love, and most of all, they remind us that sometimes, the best thing you can do is sit in a sunbeam, close your eyes, and just *be*.  

Oh, but listen to me rambling on. Shall I pour us another cup of tea? I have *plenty* more stories where that came from...

## The Grand Compendium of Cats: A Feline Tapestry Woven Through Time and Culture

Cats, those enigmatic and captivating creatures, have walked alongside humanity for millennia, evolving from wild hunters to cherished companions. This extensive document delves into the intricate world of felines, exploring their biology, behavior, history, care, and profound influence on human culture.

**I. The Feline Form: Biology and Anatomy - A Deep Dive**

* **Skeletal Structure & Biomechanics:** The cat's skeletal system is a marvel of engineering. Their flexible spine, composed of loosely articulated vertebrae, allows for an extraordinary range of motion, enabling them to contort into seemingly impossible positions and navigate tight spaces with ease. This flexibility, coupled with their powerful leg muscles, contributes to their exceptional jumping abilities, often reaching several times their own height.  Their digitigrade stance (walking on their toes) further enhances their agility and speed.
* **Muscular System & Locomotion:** Cats possess a highly developed muscular system, crucial for their predatory lifestyle and acrobatic feats.  The powerful muscles in their hind legs, particularly the quadriceps and gastrocnemius, provide the explosive power needed for leaping and sprinting. Their lithe bodies, coupled with their flexible spine, allow for quick bursts of speed and precise movements, essential for hunting, escaping danger, and engaging in playful antics.
* **Coat and Fur: A Multifaceted Covering:**  The feline coat is a complex structure that serves multiple purposes. It provides insulation against temperature extremes, offering protection from both heat and cold.  It also serves as camouflage, allowing cats to blend seamlessly into their environment, aiding them in hunting and avoiding predators. The coat's texture and color vary widely across breeds and individual cats, ranging from the short, sleek fur of the Siamese to the long, luxurious coat of the Persian.  Common patterns include tabby (striped, spotted, or marbled), calico (tri-colored, typically female), and solid.  The coat also plays a role in sensory perception, with guard hairs providing tactile information about the environment.
* **Sensory Perception: A World Beyond Human Senses:**
    * **Vision: Masters of Light and Shadow:** Cats possess exceptional vision, adapted for both daylight and low-light conditions. Their large pupils allow for maximum light intake, and their high concentration of rod cells in the retina enhances their night vision. The tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer behind the retina, further amplifies light, giving their eyes their characteristic glow and allowing them to see in near darkness.  While their visual acuity during the day is comparable to humans, their peripheral vision is wider, and their ability to detect motion is highly developed.
    * **Hearing: A Symphony of Whispers:** Cats possess an extraordinary range of hearing, far exceeding that of humans. They can detect high-pitched sounds that are beyond our auditory range, enabling them to pinpoint the rustling of prey or the squeak of a mouse from a considerable distance. Their large, mobile ears, equipped with numerous muscles, allow them to precisely locate the source of a sound.
    * **Olfaction: The Scent-Driven World:** A cat's sense of smell is their superpower.  It plays a crucial role in communication, allowing them to identify other cats, mark their territory, and assess the environment.  They use scent marking, through urination, defecation, and rubbing, to leave olfactory messages for other cats.  Their sense of smell is also essential for hunting, enabling them to track prey and detect subtle scent trails.
    * **Touch: Whiskers and Beyond:** Whiskers, or vibrissae, are highly sensitive tactile organs located on a cat's face, legs, and other parts of their body. They act as extensions of their sensory system, providing information about their surroundings, particularly in tight spaces and low-light conditions.  They help cats navigate, assess the size and shape of objects, and detect air currents.  Their paw pads are also highly sensitive, allowing them to feel vibrations and textures.
    * **Taste: A Carnivore's Palate:**  While cats have fewer taste buds than humans, they can still distinguish between different flavors, although their perception of sweetness is limited. As obligate carnivores, their taste buds are more attuned to savory and meaty flavors.
* **Physiological Processes: The Inner Workings:**
    * **Digestion: Designed for Meat:** As obligate carnivores, cats have a digestive system specifically adapted to process animal protein.  Their bodies require a diet rich in meat to thrive. They lack the enzymes necessary to efficiently digest plant-based foods.
    * **Cardiovascular System: A Heartbeat of Activity:** Cats have a relatively high heart rate, reflecting their active lifestyle and metabolic needs.
    * **Thermoregulation: Maintaining Balance:** Cats maintain their body temperature through a combination of fur insulation, behavioral adaptations (seeking warm or cool places), and physiological mechanisms like panting.

**II. The Feline Mind: Behavior and Psychology - Unraveling the Enigma**

* **Communication: A Language of Meows, Purrs, and Postures:** Cats communicate through a complex repertoire of vocalizations, including meows (used primarily to communicate with humans), purrs (often associated with contentment), hisses (a warning signal), growls (indicating aggression), and trills (a friendly greeting).  Body language plays an equally important role in their communication, encompassing tail movements (from upright and confident to tucked and fearful), ear positions (forward and alert to flattened and defensive), posture (relaxed or tense), and facial expressions. Scent marking also serves as a form of communication, conveying information about territory and individual cats.
* **Social Dynamics: More Than Just Solitary Hunters:** While often perceived as solitary creatures, cats are capable of forming strong social bonds with other cats, humans, and even other animals.  They establish hierarchies within cat colonies and engage in affiliative behaviors like mutual grooming, rubbing, and playing.  Their social interactions are complex and nuanced, reflecting their individual personalities and relationships.
* **Predatory Behavior: The Instinct to Hunt:** Even domesticated cats retain a strong hunting instinct.  Play often mimics hunting behaviors, such as stalking, chasing, pouncing, and batting at toys. This instinct is deeply ingrained in their DNA and plays a vital role in their physical and mental stimulation.
* **Territoriality: Guardians of Their Domain:** Cats are territorial animals, marking their territory using urine, feces, and scent rubbing to communicate their presence to other cats.  The size and intensity of their territoriality vary depending on the individual cat, their environment, and the presence of other cats.
* **Grooming Rituals: A Matter of Cleanliness and Comfort:** Cats are meticulous groomers, spending a significant portion of their day cleaning their fur. This behavior helps remove dirt, parasites, and loose hair, preventing matting and promoting healthy skin.  Grooming also serves as a social bonding activity between cats and can be a source of comfort and relaxation.
* **Cognitive Abilities: Clever Creatures:** Cats are intelligent creatures, capable of learning tricks, solving puzzles, and adapting to their environment. They possess excellent memories and can recognize familiar individuals, both human and feline. Their cognitive abilities are often underestimated, but they are capable of complex problem-solving and demonstrate a high level of awareness.
* **Emotional Range: A Spectrum of Feelings:** Cats experience a wide range of emotions, including joy, fear, anxiety, affection, and grief. Their emotional expressions can be subtle, but they are often communicated through their body language, vocalizations, and facial expressions.  Understanding their emotional cues is essential for building a strong and empathetic relationship.

**III. A Tail of Time: History and Domestication - A Journey Through the Ages**

* **Evolutionary Origins: From Wildcat to Companion:** The domestic cat's wild ancestor is the African wildcat ( *Felis lybica* ), a small, adaptable feline that still roams parts of Africa and the Middle East.  Genetic evidence suggests that all domestic cats descended from this single species.
* **Domestication Process: A Symbiotic Partnership:** The process of cat domestication began thousands of years ago, likely driven by a mutually beneficial relationship between humans and cats.  As humans settled into agricultural societies, they attracted rodents, which in turn attracted wildcats.  Cats that were less fearful of humans and more tolerant of their presence were more likely to thrive in these environments, eventually leading to the gradual domestication of the species.
* **Ancient Civilizations: Gods, Guardians, and Companions:** Cats held a revered status in ancient Egypt, where they were associated with deities like Bastet and considered sacred animals.  They were often depicted in art and mummified alongside their owners.  Cats were also valued in other ancient cultures, including Greece and Rome, where they were appreciated for their ability to control rodent populations.
* **Medieval Perceptions: Shadows and Superstitions:** During the Middle Ages, cats faced periods of persecution in Europe, often associated with superstition and witchcraft.  This negative association led to widespread killings of cats, which ironically contributed to the spread of diseases carried by rodents.
* **Modern Era: A Resurgence of Affection:** In the modern era, cats have regained their popularity and are now among the most beloved pets worldwide.  They are cherished for their companionship, independence, playfulness, and unique personalities.

**IV. Caring for Your Feline Friend: Health and Husbandry - A Guide to Well-being**

* **Nutritional Needs: Fueling the Feline Machine:** Cats, as obligate carnivores, have specific nutritional requirements.  Their diet must be high in animal protein, and they require certain nutrients, such as taurine, that are found only in animal tissues.  High-quality commercial cat food, formulated to meet these specific needs, is the best option for most cats.  It's crucial to avoid feeding cats dog food, as it does not contain the necessary nutrients.
* **Grooming Practices: Maintaining a Pristine Coat:** Regular grooming is essential for maintaining a cat's coat health and preventing matting, especially in long-haired breeds.
